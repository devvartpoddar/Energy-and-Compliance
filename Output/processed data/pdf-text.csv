In this order, the Commission orders the commencement of a paper hearing         established in this proceeding in an order issued on November 28, 20071 and provides         further clarification on the scope of the paper hearing.         I.      Background         2.      In August 2007, Ameren Services Company and Northern Indiana Public Service         Company; Great Lakes Utilities, Indiana Municipal Power Agency, Missouri Joint         Municipal Electric Utility Commission, Missouri River Energy Services, Prairie Power,         Inc., Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency, and Wisconsin Public Power Inc.;         and Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc. (collectively Complainants) filed three         complaints pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA)2 and Rule 206 of the         Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure3 against the Midwest Independent         Transmission System Operator, Inc. (Midwest ISO). These complaints concern the         allocation of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges to market participants under         the Midwest ISO’s Open Access Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff (TEMT).4 The         Complainants alleged that the RSG rate, which is based in part on total virtual supply         offers, is unjustly and unreasonably assessed on only a subset of virtual supply offers.         Complainants argued that there is no justification for differentiating among virtual supply         offers with regard to RSG charge allocation and that the Commission’s prior orders have         found that there is no basis to do so. Complainants asked that the Commission set for         hearing the issue of the revisions to the TEMT necessary to remedy this alleged         discrimination.         3.      In the Order on RSG Complaints, the Commission granted in part and denied in         part the relief requested in the complaints. The Commission found that the Midwest         ISO’s existing RSG cost allocation methodology may not be just and reasonable, but the         RSG cost allocation methodologies Complainants proposed had not been shown to be just         and reasonable. The Commission thus established a refund effective date of August 10,         2007 and set the complaints for paper hearing and investigation to review evidence and to         establish a just and reasonable RSG cost allocation methodology. The Commission also         held the paper hearing in abeyance pending the conclusion of a then-ongoing stakeholder                 1                   Ameren Servs. Co. v. Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys. Operator, Inc.,         121 FERC ¶ 61,205 (2007) (Order on RSG Complaints).                 2                   16 U.S.C. § 824e (2006).                 3                   18 C.F.R. § 385.206 (2008).                 4                   Additional background to this proceeding is found in the Order on RSG         Complaints, 121 FERC ¶ 61,205 at P 5-9. 20080821-3033 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2008         Docket No. EL07-86-000, et al.                                                    -3-         proceeding by the Midwest ISO RSG Task Force that was seeking to identify         improvements that could be made to the RSG cost allocation methodology or February 1,         2008, whichever is earlier.         4.      On February 1, 2008, the Midwest ISO made an informational filing stating that it         is not able to meet the February 1, 2008 deadline set in the Order on RSG Complaints         because the RSG Task Force was still in negotiations. The Midwest ISO proposed to file         specific tariff provisions and supporting documentation on or about March 3, 2008.         5.      On March 3, 2008, the Midwest ISO filed what it refers to as “indicative”         revisions to the TEMT that reflect an alternative mechanism for allocating RSG charges         and costs. The Midwest ISO explains that these provisions represent a new real-time         RSG cost allocation methodology that was developed based on the principles agreed         upon in stakeholder discussions but that has not yet been conformed to incorporate the         Midwest ISO’s new Ancillary Services Markets (ASM) market design elements. The         Midwest ISO submits that the Commission should determine whether the language in its         indicative revisions represents a just and reasonable basis for a subsequent section 205         filing that would replace the RSG cost allocation methodology for the ASM. The         Midwest ISO states that if the Commission determines that the proposed indicative         TEMT language is a just and reasonable basis for further developing provisions that         would adapt the new RSG cost allocation methodology to the ASM context, it would         agree to file, within approximately 60 days from that determination, ASM-specific         TEMT provisions embodying this suggested new allocation methodology. Within that         period, the Midwest ISO would work with stakeholders to develop ASM-adapted TEMT         language, and determine whether additional cost causation analysis is required for such         purpose.         II.     Notice of Filing         6.      Notice of the Midwest ISO’s filing was published in the Federal Register, 73 Fed.         Reg. 14,240 (2008), with interventions and protests due on or before March 24, 2008.         Numerous comments, protests or answers were filed. Timely motions to intervene were         filed by Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc. and Constellation NewEnergy,         Inc.; Cargill Power Markets, LLC; and Epic Merchant Energy, LP and SESCO         Enterprises LLC. Timely notices of intervention were filed by the Organization of MISO         States, Inc. and the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The Illinois Commerce         Commission (Illinois Commission) and the Midwest ISO’s Independent Market Monitor         (IMM) filed motions to intervene out of time.         7.      Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,         18 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2008), the notices of intervention and timely, unopposed motions to         intervene serve to make the entities that filed them parties to this proceeding. We will         grant the motions to intervene out of time filed by the Illinois Commission and the IMM. 20080821-3033 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2008         Docket No. EL07-86-000, et al.                                                      -4-         III.    Commission Determination         8.      When the Commission established a paper hearing in the Order on RSG         Complaints, it held that process in abeyance in light of a then-ongoing stakeholder         proceeding that might have resolved the issues raised by the Complainants. The Midwest         ISO has informed us that this resolution did not occur by the date specified, i.e.,         February 1, 2008, but it has nevertheless submitted TEMT revisions that it states reflect         an alternative mechanism for allocating RSG charges and costs. The Midwest ISO seeks         Commission approval of those TEMT revisions. We decline to act on that request, as it is         inconsistent with the current procedural posture of this complaint proceeding.         9.      Under section 206(b) of the FPA, the burden of proof in this proceeding rests with         the Complainants.5 It therefore is the Complainants’ responsibility to demonstrate, on the         basis of substantial evidence, both that the rate in effect is unjust and unreasonable and         that their proposed alternative rate is just and reasonable. While we appreciate the         Midwest ISO’s efforts in developing new approaches to allocating RSG costs, it is not the         Midwest ISO’s responsibility to propose and justify a new cost allocation. The Midwest         ISO’s indicative proposal is procedurally inconsistent with the current posture of this         proceeding because the Midwest ISO is not the complainant but rather the party to which         the complaints are directed. We can rule on the complaints only on the basis of         submissions made by the Complainants in which they undertake to meet the burdens that         the statute places upon them. A new proposal by the Midwest ISO cannot form an         alternative basis, and for this reason we will not evaluate the merits of the Midwest ISO’s         indicative revisions to the TEMT or address the mechanism through which the Midwest         ISO’s proposal allocates costs to various cost categories.         10.     We found in the RSG Complaint Order that a paper hearing is the most         appropriate means for the Complainants to state their positions and to provide         explanations, analysis and other materials to support those positions.6 A paper hearing         will also afford an adequate opportunity for parties opposed to the Complainants’         position to challenge the complaints. We do not consider a trial-type evidentiary hearing         suitable to this issue. The only party with data that can illuminate the issue of what the         rate should properly be, the Midwest ISO, has provided additional data and analysis in its         March 3, 2008 filing and has made that information available to all parties. Considering         that there are no issues of material fact, we find that no purpose would be served with the         cross-examination of witnesses.                 5                   E.g., New York v. FERC, 642 F.2d 1335, 1345 (D.C. Cir 1980).                 6                   Order on RSG Complaints, 121 FERC ¶ 61,205 at P 84. 20080821-3033 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2008         Docket No. EL07-86-000, et al.                                                     -5-         11.     We set the following dates for the paper hearing schedule:                         Filing of Briefs by Complainants: September 22, 2008                         Filing of Reply Briefs: October 20, 2008         12.     With respect to the scope of the paper hearing, we note the following. In order for         a section 206 complaint to succeed, the existing rate must be shown to be unjust and         unreasonable, and an alternative, just and reasonable rate must be adopted instead. In         order to determine what that alternative rate should be, we expect parties to provide         evidence bearing on the appropriate cost allocation for the RSG charge. A basis of a just         and reasonable cost allocation is cost causation. Therefore, we will permit Complainants         and other parties to include cost causation evidence in the paper hearing process. With         respect to market impacts, we will not require Complainants and other parties to offer         evidence, in the form of information or estimates, on what the market impact of the         proposed cost allocation may be in the Midwest ISO energy market or on the benefits of         virtual supply offers. While we clarify that parties can raise such concerns and offer         relevant information into the record, the primary task of the section 206 proceeding, as         stated in the Order on RSG Complaints, is to determine whether the existing rate is unjust         and unreasonable and if so, what would be a just and reasonable rate.         13.     Since our concern in this order is solely with matters of procedure and related         issues pertinent to implementing the paper hearing process, we will not address here the         various substantive arguments the parties have raised in response to the Midwest ISO’s         indicative proposal. The parties are free to restate those arguments as they see fit in the         course of the paper hearing.         The Commission orders:                 (A) The Commission hereby directs commencement of the paper hearing         instituted in the Order on RSG Complaints as discussed in the body of this order.                 (B) Pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction         conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by section 402(a) of the         Department of Energy Organization Act and by the Federal Power Act, particularly         sections 205 and 206 thereof, and pursuant to the Commission's Rules of Practice and         Procedure and the regulations under the Federal Power Act (18 C.F.R., Chapter 1), a         paper hearing shall be held as discussed in the body of the order. The Commission         directs Complainants to file briefs on the issues set for paper hearing within 30 days of         the issuance of this order. Reply briefs are due 50 days from the issuance of this order.         Each party’s presentation should separately state the facts and arguments advanced by the         party and include any and all exhibits, affidavits, and/or prepared testimony upon which 20080821-3033 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2008         Docket No. EL07-86-000, et al.                                                    -6-         the party relies.

EPIC Merchant Energy, LP, SESCO Enterprises, LLC, and CAM Energy         Trading, LLC, (collectively, Financial Marketers) filed a request for rehearing of the         Commission’s order commencing a paper hearing to investigate the Midwest Independent         Transmission System Operator, Inc.’s (Midwest ISO) then-current Revenue Sufficiency         Guarantee cost allocation methodology.1 In this order, the Commission denies that         request for rehearing.         I.      Background         2.       In 2007, a number of companies (collectively, Complainants) filed complaints         against the Midwest ISO under section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA) and Rule 206         of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure.2 These complaints concerned the         allocation of Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee charges to market participants under the         Midwest ISO’s Transmission and Energy Markets Tariff (tariff).3 The Complainants         alleged that the real-time Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee rate, which is based in part on         virtual supply offers, is unjustly and unreasonably assessed on only a subset of market         participants making both virtual supply offers and physical withdrawals of energy.4 The                 1                   Ameren Servs. Co. v. Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys. Operator, Inc.,         124 FERC ¶ 61,173 (2008) (Order Commencing Paper Hearing).                 2                   16 U.S.C. § 824e (2006); 18 C.F.R. § 385.206 (2009). The Complainants are:         Ameren Services Company and Northern Indiana Public Service Company         (Ameren/Northern Indiana); Great Lakes Utilities, Indiana Municipal Power Agency,         Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission, Missouri River Energy Services,         Prairie Power, Inc., Southern Minnesota Municipal Power Agency, and Wisconsin Public         Power Inc.; and Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.                 3                   For additional background to this proceeding, see Ameren Services Company v.         Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., 121 FERC ¶ 61,205, at P 5-9         (2007) (Order on Complaints), order on reh’g, 125 FERC ¶ 61,162 (2008).                 4                   The tariff provision that the Complainants challenged states that the real-time         Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee charge is allocated to any market participant that         “actually withdraws energy” on a given operating day. Complainants alleged that virtual         supply offers and generator deviations cause Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee charges to         be incurred, but that the provision unjustly and unreasonably assigned such costs only to                                                                                        (continued…) 20100603-3030 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/03/2010         Docket No. EL07-86-004, et al.                                                       3         Complainants argued that there is no justification for differentiating among virtual supply         offers with regard to Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee charge allocation and that the         Commission’s prior orders have found that there is no basis for doing so. The         Complainants asked the Commission to set for hearing the issue of tariff revisions         necessary to remedy this alleged discrimination.         3.       The Commission granted in part and denied in part the relief the Complainants         requested.5 It found that the Midwest ISO’s existing Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee cost         allocation methodology may not be just and reasonable, but that the methodologies the         Complainants proposed also had not been shown to be just and reasonable. The         Commission thus established a refund effective date of August 10, 2007 and instituted an         investigation under FPA section 206 to develop the cost causation analysis needed to         develop and support a revised cost allocation. The Commission set the matter for a paper         hearing rather than a trial-type hearing because the investigation would involve issues of         material fact that the Commission expected could be thoroughly presented and resolved         in writing.6 The Commission held the paper hearing in abeyance pending the conclusion         of a then-ongoing stakeholder process that was seeking to identify improvements that         could be made to the Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee cost allocation methodology. On         March 3, 2008, the Midwest ISO filed what it referred to as “indicative” revisions to the         tariff that reflected an alternative mechanism for allocating Revenue Sufficiency         Guarantee charges and costs.         4.       The Commission then ordered the commencement of the paper hearing that it had         earlier established but held in abeyance. The Commission stated that the primary task of         the FPA section 206 proceeding was to determine whether the existing rate is unjust and         unreasonable and, if so, what would be a just and reasonable rate. The Commission         noted that it had previously found that a paper hearing is the most appropriate means for         the Complainants to state their positions and to provide explanations, analysis, and other         materials to support those positions.7 It stated that a paper hearing would also afford an         adequate opportunity for parties opposed to the Complainants’ position to challenge the         complaints. The Commission also stated that it did not consider a trial-type evidentiary         hearing to be suitable in this case. It noted that the only party with data that can         illuminate the issue of what the rate should be, the Midwest ISO, provided additional data         market participants making physical withdrawals of energy.

The Commission concluded that there were no issues of material fact and for that reason         found that the cross-examination of witnesses would serve no purpose.         II.     Request for Rehearing         5.       The Financial Marketers advance three arguments in their request for rehearing.         First, they argue that the Commission established an inadequate truncated paper hearing         that gave parties only twenty days to respond to the Complainants’ briefs. The Financial         Marketers maintain that this violates due process and the requirements of the         Administrative Procedure Act. More specifically, the Financial Marketers argue that         because they will have no opportunity for discovery or cross-examination, and because         they will have only twenty days to prepare reply briefs, the paper hearing will result in an         inadequate record to support a reasoned decision regarding the Complainants’ alternative         rate proposal. Furthermore, the Financial Marketers argue that a trial-type hearing is the         only proper way to deal with the number and complexity of the material issues of fact         that are already at issue in this proceeding.         6.       Second, the Financial Marketers argue that the Order Commencing Paper Hearing         incorrectly concludes that there are no issues of material fact in dispute. They maintain         that there are many such issues, including whether the rate the Complainants proposed         will adversely affect consumers and the market as a whole by shifting so many supply         related costs to virtual transactions that this trading segment is impaired or eliminated, as         well as whether and to what extent virtual transactions cause Revenue Sufficiency         Guarantee costs to be incurred. The Financial Marketers state that these issues cannot be         adequately addressed in a written record and thus require an evidentiary hearing.         7.       Finally, the Financial Marketers state that the Order Commencing Paper Hearing         appears to go too far by stating that a primary task of this proceeding is to determine what         would be a just and reasonable rate. They maintain that if this is meant to allow the         Complainants to propose a rate alternative that differs from, or goes beyond, what they         proposed in their complaints, it would unlawfully expand the scope of this proceeding.         Allowing such proposals would be unfair and unlawful because it would require the         parties to respond to a moving target. According to the Financial Marketers, any         alternatives that differ from the proposals in the complaints must be presented in new         complaints so that the parties will have the benefit of adequate notice and the full         protections of the hearing process. The Financial Marketers state that the only alternative         rate in the complaints was the same Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee rate that the         Midwest ISO applies to physical deviations. They state that the Commission found that         applying that rate to virtual supply offers was not just and reasonable and violated cost 20100603-3030 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/03/2010         Docket No. EL07-86-004, et al.                                                       5         causation principles.8 To reconsider it in this proceeding would be arbitrary and         capricious and an abuse of discretion. Finally, the Financial Marketers argue that the         Commission should make clear that any new rate proposal submitted by Complainants         will be treated as a new filing under section 205 of the FPA for purposes of establishing         and protecting the rights of interested parties.         III.    Discussion         8.       We deny the Financial Marketers’ rehearing request. The Order Commencing         Paper Hearing served to commence the paper hearing that the Commission established in         the Order on Complaints and then held in abeyance. The additional matters discussed in         the Order Commencing Paper Hearing are all subsidiary to that action, in that they relate         to scheduling or provide clarification concerning the procedural posture of the paper         hearing. The objections that the Financial Marketers have made to the use of a paper         hearing rather than a trial-type hearing should have been raised in a request for rehearing         of the Order on Complaints.9 Rule 713(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and         Procedures requires such requests to be filed within 30 days after the order is issued,10         and the Financial Marketers filed the rehearing request under discussion here more than         10 months after the Order on Complaints was issued. The Financial Marketers’ request is         thus out of time.         9.       Although their request is out of time, we note that the Financial Marketers have         mischaracterized a number of statements made in the Order Commencing Paper Hearing,         and we will address those matters here for purposes of clarification only. First, the         Financial Marketers complain that the Order Commencing Paper Hearing allowed         insufficient time to respond to the Complainants’ briefs and no opportunity for discovery         or cross-examination. To the extent the Financial Marketers had a concern about         insufficient time, their proper course of action would be to request an extension of time to         file their brief. To the extent their concern is lack of an opportunity for discovery or         cross-examination, the substance of their argument is that the Commission improperly set                 8                   The Financial Marketers maintain that the Commission made this finding in         Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., 118 FERC ¶ 61,213, at P 84         (2007).                 9                   The Order Commencing Paper Hearing itself notes that the Commission had         already found, in the Order on Complaints, “that a paper hearing is the most appropriate         means for the Complainants to state their positions and to provide explanations, analysis         and other materials to support these positions.” Order Commencing Paper Hearing,         124 FERC ¶ 61,173 at P 10 (citing Order on Complaints, 121 FERC ¶ 61,205 at P 84).                 10                    18 C.F.R. § 385.713(b) (2009). 20100603-3030 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/03/2010         Docket No. EL07-86-004, et al.                                                        6         this matter for paper hearing, as such procedures do not fall within the scope of a paper         hearing.         10.      As explained above, the latter objection is out of time. We note here only that         even if the Financial Marketers’ filing had been timely, they have failed to show that         paper hearing procedures are inadequate in this case. As they acknowledge, the         Commission has held that “[a] paper hearing procedure is appropriate where witness         motive, intent and credibility are not at issue, and issues of material fact can be         adequately addressed on the written record.”11 The Financial Marketers nowhere point to         issues of witness motive, intent, and credibility. Their sole objection is that the number         and complexity of the factual issues involved makes a trial-type hearing necessary; yet         they do not explain why the number and complexity of the issues presented, without         more, makes paper hearing procedures inappropriate. We are therefore not persuaded         that this case cannot be resolved by paper hearing, and we reject any implication that         such procedures should be confined to instances where the issues presented are few and         straightforward.         11.      With respect to the Financial Marketers’ second argument, i.e., that the         Commission incorrectly concluded that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, we         note that they have quoted the Order Commencing Paper Hearing out of context, and thus         have misconstrued it. What the Commission said was as follows:                        A paper hearing will also afford an adequate opportunity for                        parties opposed to the Complainants’ position to challenge                        the complaints. We do not consider a trial-type evidentiary                        hearing suitable to this issue. The only party with data that                        can illuminate the issue of what the rate should properly be,                        the Midwest ISO, has provided additional data and analysis in                        its March 3, 2008 filing and has made that information                        available to all parties. Considering that there are no issues of                        material fact, we find that no purpose would be served with                        the cross-examination of witnesses.12         This statement, when read in context, means that all of the factual data necessary for the         parties to undertake their analysis was at hand, and that the factual data itself was not         disputed. If there were no issues of material fact presented of the type that the Financial                 11                    Financial Marketers Rehearing Request at 8 (citing Maryland Public Service         Commission v. PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 123 FERC ¶ 61,169 (2008) (additional         citation information omitted)).                 12                    Order Commencing Paper Hearing, 124 FERC ¶ 61,173 at P 10. 20100603-3030 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/03/2010         Docket No. EL07-86-004, et al.                                                         7         Marketers describe in their rehearing request, i.e., analytic issues regarding the         implications of the available data, then there would be no need for a hearing at all, be it a         paper or a trial-type hearing. The language in question therefore cannot have the         meaning that the Financial Marketers ascribe to it.         12.      Finally, we reject the Financial Marketers’ third argument, which is that the Order         Commencing Paper Hearing can be read to allow the Complainants to propose a rate         alternative that differs from, or goes beyond, what was proposed in their complaints. The         Financial Marketers attempt to read the simple general statement that “the primary task of         the section 206 proceeding . . . is to determine whether the existing rate is unjust and         unreasonable and if so, what would be a just and reasonable rate”13 as somehow         overruling basic principles regarding matters like proper notice and as authorizing actions         that are inconsistent with those principles. We do not see how one can draw such far-         reaching conclusions from this simple statement. When the Commission determines that         a rate is unjust and unreasonable, as it has already done here, it has a statutory obligation         to “determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification . . . to be thereafter         observed and to fix the same by order.” 16 U.S.C. 824e (2006). Moreover, the Order         Commencing Paper Hearing notes that it is “the Complainants’ responsibility to         demonstrate, on the basis of substantial evidence, both that the rate in effect is unjust and         unreasonable and that their proposed alternative rate is just and reasonable.”14         13.      The only specific point that the Financial Marketers make concerning the proper         scope of the proceeding is their assertion that, when the Midwest ISO proposed the rate         that the Complainants now propose in their complaints, the Commission found it to be         unjust and unreasonable when applied to virtual supply offers. The Financial Marketers         maintain that it thus would be improper to allow reconsideration of that rate here.         However, the specific Commission statement that the Financial Marketers cite does         nothing more than say that the “Midwest ISO provides no evidence to support its         proposal,”15 not that the proposal is not just and reasonable. We therefore find nothing in         the language that the Financial Marketers cite that places specific limitations on this         proceeding. Finally, because the Financial Marketers have not identified any rate         proposals that go beyond the scope of this proceeding, we see no reason to provide an         analysis of the applicability of section 205 or the treatment of new rate proposals under         the FPA as they request.                 13                    Id.

Background         2.       Regulation of stream flows by storage reservoirs such as the District's Great         Sacandaga Lake on a river system's headwaters can increase the generation of electricity         at downstream hydropower projects. Section 10(f) of the Federal Power Act (FPA)         provides that, whenever a licensee is directly benefited in this way by the construction         work of another licensee, a permittee, or the United States of a storage reservoir or other                  3                    140 FERC ¶ 62,089 ordering paragraph B.                  4                    Headwater benefits assessments are included under Erie Boulevard Hydropower,         L.P. Both Erie Boulevard and Finch Hydro Holdings, LLC are owned by Brookfield         Renewable Energy Group.                  5                    As explained below, Commission staff approved the transfer of the license for         the Stillwater Project No, 4684 from Stillwater Hydro Associates, LLC to GR Catalyst         One, LLC. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                            -3-         headwater improvement, the Commission shall require that the licensee “reimburse the         owner of such reservoir or other improvements for such part of the annual charges for         interest, maintenance, and depreciation thereon as the Commission may deem         equitable.”6 The Commission's regulations provide for an investigation to collect         information for determining headwater benefits charges.7 These regulations also allow         owners of downstream hydropower projects and headwater projects to negotiate a         settlement for headwater benefits charges and file the settlement for Commission         approval in lieu of an investigation.8         3.     The District’s operation of the Great Sacandaga Lake Project provides the         headwater benefits in this proceeding. Although constructed in the early twentieth         century, the Commission did not license the Great Sacandaga Lake Project until 2002. 9         However, under authority of New York state law, the District had been assessing         downstream licensees for headwater benefits for decades, and continued to do so after         2002.         4.     In 2006, Albany Engineering Corp. (Albany Engineering), the licensee for one of         the downstream beneficiary projects, the Mechanicville Project No. 6032, challenged the         District’s state assessments by filing a complaint against the District before the         Commission.10 Albany Engineering asserted the District’s assessments for headwater         benefits pursuant to New York state law were improper because FPA section 10(f)         completely preempted any state law assessments. The Commission agreed that FPA         section 10(f) preempted the New York headwater benefits statutes to the extent the New         York statutes allowed for assessments related to “interest, maintenance, and         depreciation;” however, to the extent New York law allowed for assessments outside of         “interest, maintenance, and depreciation,” the Commission found no preemption.11 On         appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that FPA section 10(f)                6                   16 U.S.C. § 803 (2012) (emphasis added).                7                   18 C.F.R. § 11.15 (2015).                8                   18 C.F.R. § 11.14(a)(1) (2015).                9                   Hudson River-Black River Regulating District, 100 FERC ¶ 61,319 (2002).                10                    The complaint was actually filed by Albany Engineering’s predecessor in         interest, Fourth Branch Associates, and later assumed by Albany Engineering.                11                    Fourth Branch Associates (Mechanicville) v. Hudson River-Black River         Regulating District, 117 FERC ¶ 61,321 (2006), reh’g denied, 119 FERC ¶ 61,141         (2007). 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                          -4-         preempted all state assessments for headwater benefits, not just assessments that covered         “interest, maintenance, and depreciation.”12         5.      Following remand, the Commission found that it lacked authority to order refunds         for the unauthorized state assessments and therefore declined to order the District to         refund payments it had previously received pursuant to preempted state law.13 Instead,         the Commission intimated that it may be able to allow amounts previously paid to the         District to offset the Commission’s FPA section 10(f) headwater benefits assessments.14         After the licensees’ attempts to reach a settlement failed, Commission staff initiated a         headwater benefits investigation to establish headwater benefits charges due the District         from the owners of the downstream projects. Commission staff issued a draft headwater         benefits determination report on January 19, 2012. The parties were given an opportunity         to comment, and the July 2012 order determining headwater benefits followed. The         July 2012 Order concluded that to the extent “downstream project owners made         payments exceeding the [FPA section 10(f) amounts], those overpayments, equitably,         should be offset against future charges.”15 The July 2012 order requested that the parties         collaboratively determine a break-even point when the annual section 10(f) assessments         determined in the July 2012 order would be offset by prior overpayments and when the         licensees would begin making section 10(f) payments to the District.16                 12                    Albany Engineering Corp. v. FERC, 548 F.3d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 2008).                 13                    Albany Engineering Corp. v. Hudson River-Black River Regulating District,         127 FERC ¶ 61,174 P 19 (2009) (“We continue to believe, as we concluded in our prior         orders, that we do not have authority to order refunds of charges collected by the District         without authority, although we may be able, at the conclusion of a headwater benefits         investigation, to permit Albany Engineering to offset amounts it owes by the amounts it         has paid to the District.”).                 14                    127 FERC ¶ 61,174 at P 3 (“We may in the future consider whether it is         appropriate to offset any amounts Albany Engineering owes the District to account for         payments it has already made.”).                 15                    140 FERC ¶ 62,089 at P 44.                 16                    On December 20, 2012, the Commission denied rehearing of issues not         pertinent to this order. 141 FERC ¶ 61,227 (2012). 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                           -5-         II.     Filings Made Pursuant to the July 2012 Order                 A.     Albany Engineering         6.      On November 22, 2013, Albany Engineering filed a letter indicating that it had         reached a resolution with the District regarding overpayments to the District for the 2003         through 2008 time period. Albany Engineering explains that it secured a judgment         against the District for the return of past unauthorized state assessments, including         interest.17 Albany Engineering further explains that, as a result of the state court         judgment, the District provided full and complete satisfaction for all excessive headwater         benefits assessments paid for 2003 through 2008.18 Therefore, Albany Engineering states         that, from 2009 forward, it will pay the District in accordance with the determinations in         the July 2012 order.         7.      On January 14, 2014, the District confirmed resolution of the matter and states that         Albany Engineering will commence payments once the Commission authorizes the         District to begin issuing bills. The July 2012 order set the annual headwater benefit         assessment for the Mechanicville Project at $7,857, so Albany Engineering owes the         District a total of $39,285 for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.19 For subsequent years,         Albany Engineering will owe the District interim assessments of $7,857 annually.                 B.     Erie Boulevard Hydropower, L.P. (Erie Boulevard)         8.      Erie Boulevard is the licensee of the E.J. West Project No. 2318, Stewart’s Bridge         Project No. 2047, Hudson River Project (Spier Falls and Sherman Island Developments)         Project No. 2482, and the Feeder Dam Project No. 2554. The July 2012 order included         Finch Hydro Holdings LLC, licensee of the Glens Falls Project No. 2385, under Erie         Boulevard, because they are both owned by the same parent company, Brookfield         Renewable Energy Group.                 17                    See Albany Engineering Corp. v. Hudson River/Black Regulating District, 973         N.Y.S.2d 391 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013).                 18                    Albany Engineering explained that it acquired the Mechanicville Project in July         2003 and became responsible for payment of headwater benefits at that time. Albany         Engineering sought no credit for 2002, because the seller, Niagara Mohawk Power         Corporation, paid the assessment for 2002.                 19                    The District’s January 14, 2014 letter actually set the amount at $38,285, which         appears to be a typographical error. The July 2012 order set annual assessments at         $7,857, resulting in $39,285 over 5 years. Including 2014, the amount owed would be         $47,142. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                           -6-         9.

Headwater Benefit                                        Assessments to Erie Boulevard                                               Year             Amount                                       2002                    $46,898                                       2003                    $199,657                                       2004                    $241,342                                       2005                    $276,858                                       2006                    $353,400                                       2007                    $366,385                                       2008                    $365,100         10.     The July 2012 Order then determined interim assessments of $365,100 a year         beginning in 2009. On October 31, 2012, Erie Boulevard filed a letter stating that         attempts to reach an agreement with the District had failed. Erie Boulevard calculates it         paid the District $9,146,507.98, resulting in an overpayment of $7,296,867.98 for the         2002 through 2008 period.20         11.     On November 13, 2012, the District responded that there has been no overpayment         by Erie Boulevard. Rather, Erie Boulevard brought a suit in state court challenging the         District’s assessments, and the issue was resolved through a May 2006 New York state         court Stipulation of Settlement and Order (2006 Settlement). The 2006 Settlement         established by agreement Erie’s payments to the District for the fiscal years beginning         July 1, 2000, and ending June 30, 2009.         12.     The District argues that the 2006 Settlement precludes Erie Boulevard from         benefiting from the Commission’s proposed method for offsetting section 10(f)         headwater benefits assessments with past overpayments.21 With regard to the fiscal years         covered by the lawsuit, the District states that the “release and forever discharge”         language in paragraph 10 of the settlement precludes Erie Boulevard from benefitting         from the Commission’s offset mechanism for any overpayments it made for these fiscal                 20                    Erie Boulevard also requests inclusion of the time value of money in the         calculations and proffers the 9 percent interest rate used by the New York state courts as         appropriate.                 21                    The District included a copy of the 2006 Settlement in its November 13, 2012         filing. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                         -7-         years.22 The District also states that in paragraph 13 of the 2006 Settlement Erie         Boulevard has waived any claims it might have as to assessments for the three budget         years beginning July 1, 2006, 2007, and 2008.23                22                   Paragraph 10 of the 2006 Settlement provides:                       Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and on behalf of any                       person or entity claiming by, through or under it, does hereby                       release and forever discharge each of the other Parties, …                       (collectively, the “Released Parties”), from any and all                       claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, damages, and causes                       of action of every kind and character, whether such claims                       arise in contract or tort, are founded upon statutory or                       common law, or whether such claims are known or unknown,                       at law or in equity (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”),                       arising out of or in any way related to the District’s budgets,                       assessments and apportionments for the budget years                       July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001, July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002,                       July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003, July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2004,                       July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005, and July 1, 2005 to                       June 30, 2006, which such Party may now have against the                       Released Parties (to the extent that such claims originated in                       whole or in part or, based on presently existing facts, that                       could have originated in whole or in part on or before that                       date hereof).                23                   Paragraph 13 provides as follows:                       Petitioner agrees to waive any future challenges or claims                       with respect to the District’s July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2007,                       July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008 and July 1, 2008 to                       June 30, 2009 budgets, assessments and/or apportionments                       and agrees not to bring any lawsuit or legal action of any kind                       challenging, contesting or disputing the District’s budgets,                       assessments and/or apportionments for the period                       July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2009.                Finally, the District states that paragraph 14 of the settlement refers         to an executed Amendment to Reservoir Operating Agreement and Letter         Agreement, which, according to the District, represents valuable         consideration received by Erie Boulevard in exchange for the settlement. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                           -8-         13.     On December 3, 2012, Erie Boulevard responded. It argues that paragraph 10 is         inapplicable because its current claim of overpayment did not arise until the November         2008 federal court judgment and, therefore, did not exist at the time of the settlement and         could not have been covered by the settlement. Further, Erie Boulevard argues that         paragraph 10 is applicable only to causes of action and claims brought or asserted in         adversarial court proceedings rather than non-adversarial processes such as the present         administrative proceeding before the Commission. Erie Boulevard contends that         paragraph 13 is inapplicable because the present administrative proceeding is not a         lawsuit brought by Erie Boulevard or a claim advanced by Erie Boulevard. Finally, Erie         Boulevard stated the District should have raised the waiver issue much earlier in these         proceedings.24         14.     On December 18, 2014, Erie Boulevard supplemented the record. Erie Boulevard         states the District initiated a declaratory judgment action in New York state court, which         was dismissed after Erie Boulevard removed the action to federal court. The District         originally filed the case, seeking declaration that the 2006 Settlement precluded Erie         Boulevard’s claim for a refund of assessments collected between July 1, 2000, and         June 30, 2009. The federal court dismissed the action for two reasons. First, the court         found the declaratory judgment case moot because Erie Boulevard was not pursuing a         refund, but rather credits before the Commission. Second, even if the issue were not         moot, the court determined the Commission should decide the matter. Erie Boulevard         also states that, because the 2006 Settlement was not submitted to the Commission for         approval as required by 18 C.F.R. § 11.14(a) (2015), the settlement cannot affect the         equitable determination of FPA section 10(f) headwater benefit assessments.25 Further,         Erie Boulevard argues that using the 2006 Settlement would “resurrect the preempted and                 24                    Erie Boulevard responds to the District’s contention that Erie received valuable         consideration in exchange for the settlement (see id.), contending that the Amendment to         Reservoir Operating Agreement and Letter Agreement referred to in paragraph 14 of the         settlement was of no consequence because, even if it was valuable consideration for the         execution of the settlement, the waiver provisions of paragraphs 10 and 14 do not apply         here.                 25                    See Fourth Branch Associates (Mechanicsville) v. Hudson River - Black River         Regulating District, 117 FERC ¶ 61,321 n.48 (2006) (“This settlement was not submitted         to or approved by the Commission, and it does not affect our responsibility under         section 10(f) to determine the proportion of the equitable charges for interest,         maintenance, and depreciation that each downstream hydropower project owner receiving         headwater benefits should pay the District.”); 119 FERC ¶ 61,141 P 35 (2007) (“The         settlement was not submitted to the Commission for approval and does not reflect a         Commission determination of the charges that Erie should pay under section 10(f).”). 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                             -9-         defunct New York State scheme and retain for itself the vast majority of the payments it         received from Erie in response to the District’s assessments under that illegal scheme.”26         15.     The District responded on December 24, 2014. It argues that, in the event the         Commission finds that enforcement of the 2006 Settlement is preempted such that Erie         Boulevard can take advantage of the crediting mechanism, the Commission should also         find that the entire 2006 Settlement is preempted, in particular those provisions involving         the Amendment to Reservoir Operating Agreement contemplated at paragraph 14 of the         2006 Settlement. The District explains that a Commission finding that the FPA         completely preempts the 2006 Settlement “would negate the six year extension of the         Reservoir Operating Agreement.”27 The District states that finding one section (Erie         Boulevard’s waiver) preempted without the other (Amendment to Reservoir Operating         Agreement) would be inequitable. In the alternative, the District requests the         appointment of a settlement judge to implement the state and federal court decisions         affecting headwater benefit assessments.         16.     In a February 10, 2015 filing, Erie Boulevard opposes the appointment of a         settlement judge, arguing that: (1) there is nothing about the federal court’s dismissal of         the District’s lawsuit that needs to be addressed by a Commission settlement judge;         (2) the appointment of a settlement judge would contravene the process chosen in the         July 2012 order; (3) and prior settlement conferences between Erie Boulevard and the         District failed. Erie Boulevard reiterates its position that the District’s reliance on the         waiver in the 2006 Settlement has come far too late.         17.     We agree with Erie Boulevard that there is no need for settlement proceedings.         This order addresses the filings called for in the July 2012 order, and those filings provide         a sufficient basis to resolve the issues herein.         18.     Although not required to do so, the July 2012 order established a crediting         mechanism to address prior overpayments for state headwater benefit assessments. As         provided in FPA section 10(f), the purpose of the crediting mechanism is to require         payments that the Commission “deem[s] equitable.”         19.     Erie Boulevard chose state litigation to challenge the amount of the District’s state         assessments. Erie Boulevard and the District resolved the issue and established         assessments for July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2009, that both the District and Erie         Boulevard believed were fair and reasonable, with both agreeing to give up “any and all         claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, damages, and causes of action of every kind and                 26                    Erie Boulevard December 18, 2014 filing at 8.                 27                    District December 24, 2014 Filing at 2. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                         - 10 -         character, whether such claims arise in contract or tort, are founded upon statutory or         common law, or whether such claims are known or unknown, at law or in equity … in         any way related to the District’s … assessments …” for budget years 2002 through         June 30, 2009.28 Under these circumstances, it is reasonable and equitable to hold Erie         Boulevard and the District to the bargain they struck regarding these payments.         Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2009, Erie’s section 10(f) assessments will be $365,100         annually.         20.    Contrary to Erie Boulevard’s and the District’s concerns, our determination of         what is fair and equitable in this case in no way affects the validity of the         2006 Settlement. Nor, as Erie Boulevard argues, is the 2006 Settlement an offer of         settlement under Rule 602 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure that         requires Commission approval.29 Rather, the District provided a copy of the         2006 Settlement to support its view of how the Commission should resolve the issue of         how Erie Boulevard’s headwater benefits assessments should be calculated.                C.      Northern Electric and South Glens Falls, and New York State Electric                        and Gas Corp.         21.    On March 15, 2013, South Glens Falls Limited Partnership and Niagara Mohawk         Power Corp. (collectively, South Glens Falls) (Project No. 5461) and Northern Electric         Power Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. (collectively, Northern Electric) (Project         No. 5276) filed a joint letter asking the Commission to delay calculating a break-even         point, explaining that pending litigation in New York state court might resolve the issue         of unauthorized past assessments. Information submitted with the March 15, 2013 filing         shows that South Glens Falls paid the District $761,812.53, resulting in overpayment of         $359,330.5330 and that Northern Electric paid the District $2,753,816.51, resulting in         overpayment of $2,368,480.51.                28                   See 2006 Settlement, paragraph 10, n. 21, supra. Erie Boulevard instead could         have chosen, as Albany Engineering did, to challenge the legality of the assessments         under the FPA. But it did not.                29                   See 18 C.F.R. § 385.602 (2015).                30                   South Glens Falls actually calculates the amount to be $359,329.52, which         appears to be a typographical error. 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                         - 11 -         22.     Despite success in lower court rulings, on November 26, 2014, the New York         Supreme Court, Appellate Division, dismissed the complaints filed by South Glens Falls         and Northern Electric, finding that the claims were time-barred.31         23.     New York State Electric and Gas Corporation (NYSEG), the licensee for the         Upper Mechanicville Project No. 2934, filed a letter on October 31, 2012, indicating that         its attempts to resolve the issue with the District failed.32 NYSEG indicated payment to         the District of $714,077.27, resulting in overpayment of $587,616.27. However, NYSEG         also filed a complaint against the District seeking a refund of state assessments, and on         November 26, 2014 – the same day the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division,         dismissed the South Glens Falls and Northern Electric complaints – the court similarly         held that NYSEG’s separate litigation against the District was likewise time-barred.33         24.     In its December 24, 2014 letter, the District argued the two New York state court         opinions dismissing the Northern Electric and South Glens Falls, and NYSEG complaints         mean the Commission should order these parties to “commence payment of headwater         benefit assessments as specified from 2002 onward.”34         25.     However, these parties’ failure to secure a refund in New York state court based         on state statute of limitations principles does not preclude the Commission from allowing         these parties to participate in the crediting mechanism to determine headwater benefits         assessments that it deems equitable. Accordingly, Northern Electric and South Glens         Falls, and NYSEG will be treated like the other beneficiary licensees who have not         resolved their issues through other avenues, meaning they will participate in the crediting         mechanism.                 D.      Remaining Projects         26.     Curtis/Palmer, the licensee of the Curtis/Palmer Falls Project No. 2609, filed a         status update on August 15, 2013. Curtis/Palmer stated that it and the District could not         agree on a remedy for the unauthorized state assessments.

Fort Miller Associates holds an exemption from licensing for the Fort Miller         Project No. 4226.36 On November 5, 2012, Fort Miller filed a letter indicating it paid the         District $418,957, resulting in overpayment of $382,943.         28.     On January 8, 2015, Stillwater Hydro Associates, LLC37 (Stillwater) filed a copy         of its November 24, 2014 letter to the District indicating it paid the District $317,561,         resulting in an overpayment of $301,203 for the 2002 to 2008 period.38         29.     Green Island Power Authority (GIPA) and Albany Engineering Corp.,39 co-         licensees for the Green Island Hydroelectric Project No. 13, filed a letter on                 35                    Curtis/Palmer’s filing states an overpayment amount of $3,519,980, an FPA         section 10(f) amount of $682,648, and a total assessment paid of $4,202,649. The actual         FPA section 10(f) amount calculated in the July 2012 Order for Curtis/Palmer was         $682,647. July 2012 Order, 140 FERC ¶ 62,089 P 40, Table 4. The sum of the         Assessment Paid column on page 3 of the filing is $4,202,648. We recognize that         rounding may account for the discrepancy. There also appears to be a typographical error         in the Excessive Payment/Credit value for the assessment year beginning July 1, 2004.                 36                    Long Lake Energy Corp., 18 FERC ¶ 62,560 (1982).                 37                    On October 21, 2014, Commission staff approved the transfer of the license for         the Stillwater Hydroelectric Project No. 4684 from Stillwater Hydro Associates, LLC to         GR Catalyst One, LLC. Stillwater Hydro Associates, LLC, 149 FERC ¶ 62,045 (2014).                 38                    This order adjusts downward Stillwater’s FPA section 10(f) assessment for         2002. In its filing, Stillwater must have accounted for the entire year; however,         Commission staff prorated the 2002 assessment to include only 3 months because the         District’s project was not licensed until September 25, 2002. 140 FERC ¶ 62,089 at         Table 4.                 39                    On November 14, 2014, Commission staff approved the partial transfer of the         license for the Green Island Project from Green Island Power Authority, as sole licensee,         to Green Island Power Authority and Albany Engineering Corporation as co-licensees.         149 FERC ¶ 62,108 (2014). 20150821-3037 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 08/21/2015         Docket No. HB81-9-2-002                                                          - 13 -         November 6, 2012, indicating payment to the District of $515,323, resulting in an         overpayment of $457,783.40.40         30.     Based on the filings, Curtis/Palmer, Fort Miller Associates, Stillwater, and GIPA         and Albany Engineering were unable to fashion an agreement on payment for headwater         benefits. Accordingly, they will participate in the crediting mechanism, as discussed         below.         III.    Resolution of Overpayments         31.     Some of the beneficiaries have requested that the Commission compute interest on         the overpayment amounts. However, the Commission does not compute interest in         headwater benefits cases where licensees are assessed headwater benefits retroactively,         where the same time value of money arguments would be applicable. The selection of         the offset mechanism is an attempt to avoid an inequitable requirement of double         payment on the part of the beneficiaries, rather than an attempt to make the beneficiaries         whole because of an unauthorized application of state law.         32.     Finally, this order determines the point at which annual assessments established in         the July 2012 order would be completely offset by prior preempted overpayments and         determines when FPA section 10(f) assessments should commence. In its         October 31, 2012 letter, the District indicated that the numbers provided by the         downstream beneficiaries were largely correct.41 Table 3 shows the amount of section         10(f) headwater benefits assessments calculated for the years 2002 to 2008 (column b).         Next, based on the post July 2012 order filings, the table shows the amount the         beneficiaries had paid the District for unauthorized state assessments (column c) followed         by the resulting overpayment (column d). Dividing the overpayment by the Commission-         determined section 10(f) assessments going forward (column e), the table next shows the         number of whole years before the unauthorized assessments are offset (column f) and the         year when such offset occurs (column g). This results in a remainder (column h) that         partially reduces the following year's assessment (column i). After that partially-reduced         year, the annual section 10(f) assessment going forward (column e) is applicable.                 40                    GIPA’s filing states an overpayment amount of $457,782.40, using an FPA         section 10(f) amount of $31,541. The actual FPA section 10(f) amount calculated in the         July 2012 Order for GIPA was $31,540.

(Albany Engineering) filed a request         for clarification. For the reasons discussed below, we grant Erie Boulevard’s rehearing in         part, deny the Boralex Companies’ rehearing, and dismiss the stay requests as moot. We         also grant Albany Engineering clarification as explained below.         I.      Background                 A.      Statutory Overview         2.      Regulation of streamflow by storage projects on a river system's headwaters can         increase the electric generation potential at downstream hydropower projects.         Section 10(f) of the FPA provides:                         That whenever any licensee hereunder is directly benefited by                         the construction work of another licensee, a permittee, or of                         the United States of a storage reservoir or other headwater                         improvement, the Commission shall require as a condition of                         the license that the licensee so benefited shall reimburse the                         owner of such reservoir or other improvements for such part                         of the annual charges for interest, maintenance, and                         depreciation thereon as the Commission may deem equitable.                         The proportion of such charges to be paid by any licensee                         shall be determined by the Commission.         3.      Under the Commission’s regulations, owners of downstream and headwater         projects may negotiate a settlement for these charges and file it for Commission         approval.4 If, as pertinent here, the parties are unable to reach agreement, and one of the         parties asks the Commission to determine the charges, the Commission will conduct an         investigation and collect information for determining headwater benefits charges.5                 2                   16 U.S.C. § 803(f) (2012).                 3                   152 FERC ¶ 62,124 (2015) (August 2015 Order).                 4                   18 C.F.R. § 11.14(a)(1) (2015).                 5                   18 C.F.R. § 11.15 (2015). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                -3-                 B.     Parties         4.      The District’s Great Sacandaga Lake Project confers benefits in the form of         regulated flow of water to 13 downstream projects. Erie Boulevard is the licensee for         four of the downstream beneficiary projects: E.J. West Project No. 2318, Stewart's         Bridge Project No. 2047, Hudson River Project No. 2482, and the Feeder Dam Project         No. 2554. These proceedings have treated the Glens Falls Project No. 2385 as if Erie         Boulevard is the licensee, when in fact the project has been licensed to FH Opco LLC         since May 2007.6 Both FH Opco LLC and Erie Boulevard are subsidiaries of Brookfield         Renewable Energy Group (Brookfield).         5.      The Boralex Companies are licensees for two other beneficiary projects: South         Glens Falls is co-licensee for the South Glens Falls Project No. 5461; and Northern         Electric is co-licensee for the Hudson Falls Project No. 5276.7                 C.     Procedural Background         6.      The Conklingville Dam, which impounds the Great Sacandaga Lake, was         constructed in the 1920s-1930s, and over the years the District assessed downstream         entities (including licensees) for headwater benefits under authority of New York’s         Environmental Conservation Law. After the Commission licensed the Great Sacandaga         Lake Project No. 12252 in 2002,8 the District continued to assess headwater benefits         under state law.                        1.      Erie Boulevard’s 2006 Settlement         7.      In 2002, after the Commission licensed the District’s Great Sacandaga Lake         Project, Erie Boulevard sued the District in New York Supreme Court, challenging the                 6                   The Glens Falls Project was licensed to Finch, Pruyn, and Company, Inc. in         2001, Finch, Pruyn and Co., Inc., 97 FERC ¶ 62,170 (2001), and the license was         transferred to Finch Hydro Holdings LLC in May 2007, Finch, Pruyn and Co., Inc. and         Finch Hydro Holdings LLC, 119 FERC ¶ 62,133 (2007). In June 2007, Finch Hydro         Holdings LLC changed its name to FH Opco LLC. The contacts for Erie Boulevard’s         and FP Opco’s projects are the same. See, e.g., Brookfield’s January 6, 2012 filing in         Project Nos. 2318, 2385, et al.                 7                   Niagara Mohawk Power Company is the other co-licensee for both the South         Glens Falls and the Hudson Falls Projects.                 8                   Hudson River - Black River Regulating District, 100 FERC ¶ 61,319 (2002). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                 -4-         District’s headwater benefits assessments under New York state law for its four         beneficiary projects9 for the six budget years from July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2006.         Erie Boulevard challenged the District’s “budgets, assessments, and apportionments.” In         May 2006, Erie Boulevard and the District agreed to settle the lawsuit, and filed a         settlement (2006 Settlement) with the court that resulted in a credit to Erie Boulevard of         $822,220 that would be used to reduce its payments to the District for budget years         July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2009.10         8.     In paragraph 10 of the 2006 Settlement, Erie Boulevard agreed to release the         District from any claims relating to the six budget years (July 1, 2000, through June 30,         2006):11                       Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and on behalf of any                       person or entity claiming by, through or under it, does hereby                       release and forever discharge each of the other Parties, …                       (collectively, the “Released Parties”), from any and all                       claims, demands, judgments, liabilities, damages, and causes                       of action of every kind and character, whether such claims                       arise in contract or tort, are founded upon statutory or                       common law, or whether such claims are known or unknown,                       at law or in equity (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”),                       arising out of or in any way related to the District’s budgets,                       assessments and apportionments for the budget years July 1,                       2000 to … June 30, 2006, which such Party may now have                       against the Released Parties (to the extent that such claims                       originated in whole or in part or, based on presently existing                       facts, that could have originated in whole or in part on or                       before that date hereof).                9                  E.J. West Project No. 2318, Stewart's Bridge Project No. 2047, Hudson River         Project No. 2482, and the Feeder Dam Project No. 2554. For budget years 2002 through         June 2006, the District had charged Erie Boulevard (and Erie Boulevard had paid)         $4,465,029 (rounded to the nearest dollar).                10                   See District’s November 13, 2012 Filing, Docket No. HB81-09-2-1 (attaching         copy of 2006 Settlement). Erie Boulevard’s reduced payments for its four projects for         budget years 2006 through 2008 totaled $4,401,491 (rounded to the nearest dollar).                11                   2006 Settlement P 10. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                -5-         9.      In paragraph 13, Erie Boulevard also agreed to release any claims related to the         three budget years from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2009:12                         Petitioner agrees to waive any future challenges or claims                         with respect to the District’s July 1, 2006 … to June 30, 2009                         budgets, assessments and/or apportionments and agrees not to                         bring any lawsuit or legal action of any kind challenging,                         contesting or disputing the District’s budgets, assessments                         and/or apportionments for the period July 1, 2006 to June 30,                         2009.         10.     The New York Supreme Court approved the 2006 Settlement on May 23, 2006.13                         2.     Albany Engineering’s Complaint Proceeding         11.     In July 2006, Albany Engineering Corp. (Albany Engineering), the licensee for         one of the downstream beneficiaries, the Mechanicville Project No. 6032, took a different         path. Albany Engineering challenged the District’s New York state assessments by filing         a complaint at the Commission against the District. Albany Engineering asserted the         District’s assessments for headwater benefits under color of New York state law were         preempted by FPA section 10(f).         12.     The Commission agreed that FPA section 10(f) preempted the New York         headwater benefits scheme to the extent New York law allowed for assessments related         to “interest, maintenance, and depreciation;” however, to the extent New York law         allowed for assessments outside of “interest, maintenance, and depreciation,” the         Commission found no preemption.14         13.     Albany Engineering sought judicial review, and in November 2008, the United         States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that FPA section 10(f)         preempted all state assessments for headwater benefits, not just assessments for “interest,                 12                    Id.

Following remand, Albany Engineering requested that the Commission require the         District to refund with interest amounts Albany Engineering had paid under color of the         preempted state law.17 In May 2009, the Commission issued an order (2009 Remand         Order) determining that, inasmuch as the payments to the District were neither demanded         nor made with reference to a Commission determination or through a Commission         proceeding, the District was not in violation of its license, and the Commission therefore         lacked authority to order refunds for these unauthorized state assessments.18 Although it         could not order the District to make refunds, the Commission said that it “may in the         future consider whether it is appropriate to offset any amounts Albany Engineering owes         the District to account for payments it has already made.”19 The Commission explained         that, if Albany Engineering insisted on obtaining an immediate refund of the payments,         rather than a remedy that the Commission may be able to provide, it should do so through         court action.20                  15                     Albany Engineering Corp. v. FERC, 548 F.3d 1071 (D.C.

In support of this finding, the         Commission explained that “[s]ection 10(f) requires downstream licensees to reimburse         upstream storage project owners for ‘such part of the annual charges for interest,         maintenance, and depreciation… as the Commission may deem equitable.’” Id.

Albany Engineering pursued a remedy through the New York state courts and         received a refund of state assessments for the years 2003 through 2008, including         interest.21                         3.      Commission Determination of Headwater Benefits         16.     Because the District and downstream licensees thereafter proved unable to agree         on FPA section 10(f) headwater benefits assessments, Commission staff at the request of         the District initiated a headwater benefits investigation to establish section 10(f)         assessments.22 Commission staff issued for comment a draft headwater benefits         determination report on January 19, 2012. In its comments on the draft report, the         District stated that it “expressly reserves its right to raise any legal or equitable grounds         for limiting the extent of credits against Headwater Benefits charges for payments made         by licensees under color of State law prior to the [2008 Albany Engineering decision].”23         17.     Following the submission of comments, Commission staff issued an order         determining headwater benefits.24 The July 2012 Order resolved issues raised in         response to the draft report, and determined the extent of benefits the operation and         maintenance of the Great Sacandaga Lake Project conferred to the downstream projects         for the period 2002 through 2008.25 The order also determined interim assessments         beginning in 2009.         18.     With respect to Erie Boulevard, the July 2012 Order found that the sum of Erie         Boulevard’s FPA section 10(f) assessments for the period 2002 through 2008 was         $1,849,640.26 This amount included not only Erie Boulevard’s four projects (E.J. West,         Stewart’s Bridge, Hudson River, and Feeder Dam), but also FH Opco’s Glens Falls                 21                    Albany Engineering August 22, 2012, and November 22, 2013 Filing.

As for future interim assessments, the July 2012 Order also again combined         these five projects, and determined an interim annual amount of $365,100.27         19.     After determining final and interim section 10(f) assessments, the July 2012 Order         turned to the question of how to handle previous assessments the District had collected         under color of New York state law. The order stated:                         To the extent that the downstream project owners have                         already paid the District under New York law for what were,                         incontestably, headwater benefits, requiring those project                         owners to pay the District yet again for headwater benefits for                         those years, this time under section 10(f), would amount to a                         double payment that could not be reconciled with the                         Commission's responsibility to ensure reimbursements that                         are “equitable.”28         20.     The order also was concerned with state assessments that may have exceeded the         section 10(f) amount:                         Moreover, to the extent that, while the Great Sacandaga Lake                         Project has been under license, any of the downstream project                         owners made payments exceeding the amounts that this order                         finds were owed for those years, those overpayments,                         equitably, should be offset against future charges.29         21.     The July 2012 Order recognized that the point at which the annual section 10(f)         assessments would be completely offset by prior payments to the District would vary         from project to project, and that the amounts paid by the downstream project owners to         the District were not part of the record of the Commission proceeding. In addition, the         order stated that “downstream project owners may already have obtained refunds from         the District through court action or other means.”30         22.     The order therefore requested that the parties collaboratively determine a break-         even point when the annual section 10(f) assessments determined in the July 2012 Order                 27                    Id.

The order required the 13 downstream         beneficiaries to file individual agreements that reflected: (1) Commission-determined         headwater benefits assessments for the period 2002 through 2008; (2) annual interim         assessments beginning in 2009; and (3) payments made pursuant to New York state law         that each of the beneficiary projects made to the District since Commission licensing of         the Great Sacandaga Lake Project in 2002.31                         4.     Post-July 2012 Order Filings and August 2015 Order         23.     On October 31, 2012, Erie Boulevard filed a letter stating that attempts to reach an         agreement with the District had failed. Erie Boulevard calculated it paid the District         $9,146,507.98, resulting in an overpayment of $7,296,867.98 for 2002 through 2008.         Erie Boulevard attached a table to its letter showing state assessments for each year for         each project.32         24.     On November 13, 2012, the District responded that there had been no         overpayment by Erie Boulevard. Rather, the District maintained that the lawsuit and         2006 Settlement resolved headwater benefits assessments for Erie Boulevard for the         budget years July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2009. Thus, according to the District, Erie         Boulevard had essentially waived any arguments as to the District’s charges for the 2002         through June 2009 budget years, and there should be no offset for these charges against         future section 10(f) assessments.         25.     In its December 3, 2012 response, Erie Boulevard argued that paragraph 10 of the         2006 Settlement is inapplicable because its current claim of overpayment did not arise         until the Albany Engineering decision in November 2008; therefore, a claim did not exist         at the time of the settlement and could not have been covered by it. Further, Erie         Boulevard argued that paragraph 10 is applicable only to causes of action and claims         brought or asserted in adversarial court proceedings rather than non-adversarial processes         such as these administrative proceedings. Erie Boulevard contended that paragraph 13 is         inapplicable because this administrative proceeding is not a lawsuit brought by Erie         Boulevard or a claim advanced by Erie Boulevard. Finally, Erie Boulevard stated the         District should have raised the waiver issue much earlier.                 31                    Id. Ordering Paragraph (B).                 32                    This amount included Erie Boulevard’s payments for FH Opco’s Glens Falls         Project of $139,769.51 for budget years 2007 (when FH Opco became the licensee) and         2008, for a total of $279,539 (rounded to nearest dollar). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 10 -         26.     On December 18, 2014, Erie Boulevard supplemented the record, contending that         because the 2006 Settlement was not submitted to the Commission for approval as         required by 18 C.F.R. § 11.14(a) (2014), the settlement cannot affect the equitable         determination of FPA section 10(f) headwater benefit assessments. Further, Erie         Boulevard stated that using the 2006 Settlement would “resurrect the preempted and         defunct New York State scheme and retain for [the District] the vast majority of the         payments it received from Erie Boulevard in response to the District’s assessments under         that illegal scheme.”33         27.     On August 21, 2015, Commission staff issued its order, crediting Erie Boulevard         for its prior state law assessments up to the section 10(f) amount determined in the July         2012 Order, thereby avoiding double payment for the years 2002 through 2008.         However, the August 2015 Order determined that the equities surrounding the 2006         Settlement made it inappropriate to allow Erie Boulevard to offset future section 10(f)         assessments with the state law assessments to which it had agreed in the 2006 Settlement.         28.     The August 2015 Order, relying on the analysis from the 2009 Remand Order and         2009 Remand Rehearing Order, explained that:                         Although not required to do so, the July 2012 order                         established a crediting mechanism to address prior                         overpayments for state headwater benefit assessments. As                         provided in FPA section 10(f), the purpose of the crediting                         mechanism is to require payments that the Commission                         “deem[s] equitable.”34         29.     In the case of Erie Boulevard and the District, the August 2015 Order stated:                         Erie Boulevard chose state litigation to challenge the amount                         of the District’s state assessments. Erie Boulevard and the                         District resolved the issue and established assessments for                         July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2009, that both the District and                         Erie Boulevard believed were fair and reasonable, with both                         agreeing to give up “any and all claims, demands, judgments,                         liabilities, damages, and causes of action of every kind and                         character, whether such claims arise in contract or tort, are                 33                    The District responded on December 24, 2014, and Erie Boulevard responded to         the District on February 10, 2015.                 34                    August 2015 Order, 152 FERC ¶ 62,124 at P 18. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                 - 11 -                         founded upon statutory or common law, or whether such                         claims are known or unknown, at law or in equity … in any                         way related to the District’s … assessments …” for budget                         years 2002 through June 30, 2009. [footnote omitted] Under                         these circumstances, it is reasonable and equitable to hold                         Erie Boulevard and the District to the bargain they struck                         regarding these payments.35         II.     Discussion                 A.      Erie Boulevard Rehearing Request         30.     On rehearing, Erie Boulevard argues that (1) the August 2015 Order relied on         truncated sections of the 2006 Settlement; (2) the August 2015 Order ignored prior         Commission orders; (3) the District’s reliance on the 2006 Settlement amounted to an         untimely collateral attack on the July 2012 Order; (4) reliance on the 2006 Settlement         was not based on substantial evidence in the record; (5) reliance on the 2006 Settlement         was not in accordance with the FPA and the Commission's regulations; (6) denying         equitable relief effectively resurrected a state statutory scheme for assessing headwater         benefits that Albany Engineering had held to be preempted; (7) denial of equitable relief         to Erie Boulevard was particularly inappropriate in light of the fact that only it and         Albany Engineering had provided timely notice of objection to the state law assessments;         (8) the August 2015 Order erroneously included the Glens Falls Project among Erie         Boulevard’s other projects subject to the 2006 Settlement; and (9) the August 2015 Order         erroneously denied interest.                         1.     Given the 2006 Settlement, the August 2015 Order reasonably                                denied credits for Erie Boulevard’s payments to the District                                pursuant to state law.         31.     Erie Boulevard asserts that the August 2015 Order’s reliance on the 2006         Settlement to deny it equitable relief was misplaced. It contends that the order failed to         recognize that paragraph 10 of the Settlement provides that the parties agreed to give up         all claims the parties “may now have.” Erie Boulevard maintains that it did not have a         preemption claim against the District at the time it entered into the 2006 Settlement                 35                    Id. P 19. The order also noted that “Erie Boulevard instead could have chosen,         as Albany Engineering did, to challenge the legality of the assessments under the FPA.         But it did not.” Id. n.28. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 12 -         because that claim is based on the preemption of the state scheme by the FPA, a claim         that did not arise until the 2008 Albany Engineering decision.36         32.      Erie Boulevard’s analysis of whether it had a “claim” does not comport with the         language of paragraph 10. The August 2015 Order set forth in full the relevant         provisions of paragraphs 10 (which applies to budget years July 2000-June 2006) and 13         (which applies to budget years July 2006-June 2009) of the 2006 Settlement, and they are         again set forth above. Language from paragraphs 10 and 13 shows the parties intended a         broad release. Paragraph 10’s broad language applies to “claims, demands, judgments,         liabilities, damages, and causes of action,” and includes phrases such as “any and all” and         “of every kind and character” to emphasize the expansive breadth of the release. The         release applies to such claims whether they were “known or unknown,” and covers         claims that are “based on presently existing facts.” Paragraph 13 also contains very         broad language. Erie Boulevard “agrees to waive any future challenges or claims” with         respect to the District’s budgets, assessments and/or apportionments for budget years July         2006-June 2009 and “agrees not to bring any lawsuit or legal action of any kind         challenging, contesting or disputing” the District’s assessments for these years.         33.      Erie Boulevard places great emphasis on the “which such Party may now have”         language in paragraph 10, but in doing so it ignores the language that immediately         follows. The release applies to any and all claims “which such Party may have against         the Released Parties (to the extent that such claims originated in whole or in part or,         based on presently existing facts, that could have originated in whole or in part on or         before the date hereof.)” (Emphasis added.) The relevant facts arose in 2002 when the         Commission issued the District a license for the Great Sacandaga Lake Project and when         the District continued to assess downstream beneficiaries based on state law. That Erie         Boulevard had a claim is demonstrated by the fact that Albany Engineering, which was in         a similar position to Erie Boulevard, litigated and prevailed on its claim.         34.      Erie Boulevard, like Albany Engineering, “could have” made a claim against the         District, arguing that the District’s assessments were illegal. The Albany Engineering         decision supports this view, recognizing that from the time the District received its         license in 2002, the District lacked the authority to make assessments under state law.37         Erie Boulevard could have refused to pay the assessments on the grounds they were         preempted, and could have sought return of assessments already paid. Instead, Erie         Boulevard sued the District, challenging the specific amount being assessed, and then         signed a release broadly covering any additional challenges to those amounts.                  36                     Erie Boulevard Rehearing Request at 10-11.                  37                     548 F.3d 1071, 1079. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                 - 13 -         35.     Erie Boulevard argues the Albany Engineering decision was not a presently         existing “fact.”38 This argument confuses facts with law. To be sure, the “fact” of the         Albany Engineering decision represented helpful precedent to Erie Boulevard; however,         it does not follow that this precedent created a claim that did not previously exist. The         decision represents an interpretation of law, not the creation of new facts. The facts upon         which Albany Engineering mounted its successful challenge to the District’s assessments         existed when Erie Boulevard entered into the settlement.         36.     Erie Boulevard challenged certain aspects of the District’s assessments, settled         these challenges, and as part of that settlement agreed to broadly release all claims         regarding those state assessments, not excluding claims based on federal preemption.         Accordingly, the August 2015 Order correctly denied Erie Boulevard equitable relief         from the charges it had agreed to pay the District.                         2.     Prior orders in these proceedings did not bind the Commission                                to allow credits for Erie Boulevard’s payments under state law.         37.     Erie Boulevard maintains that giving effect to the 2006 Settlement is contrary to         Commission precedent. In support, the company cites the 2006 Complaint Order39 and         the 2007 Complaint Rehearing Order:                         [T]he fact that the District and Erie reached a settlement in                         respect to Erie's assessments does not affect our authority                         under section 10(f) to determine the proportion of equitable                         charges for interest, maintenance, and depreciation that each                         downstream hydropower beneficiary should pay the District.                         The settlement was not submitted to the Commission for                         approval and does not reflect a Commission determination of                         the charges that Erie should pay under section 10(f).40                 38                    Erie Boulevard Rehearing Request at 11 n.2.                 39                    2006 Complaint Order, 117 FERC ¶ 61,321 at P 53 n.48 (“This settlement was         not submitted to or approved by the Commission, and it does not affect our responsibility         under section 10(f) to determine the proportion of the equitable charges for interest,         maintenance, and depreciation that each downstream hydropower project owner receiving         headwater benefits should pay the District.”).                 40                    2007 Complaint Rehearing Order, 119 FERC ¶ 61,141 at P 35 (footnotes         omitted). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                               - 14 -         38.    The 2006 Complaint Order and 2007 Complaint Rehearing Order were reversed         and remanded by Albany Engineering; thus, they do not serve as controlling precedent         here. Indeed, as the court explained in Albany Engineering,                               Our holding that § 10(f) preempts all state headwater                        benefits assessments materially changes the context for                        FERC’s consideration of both these issues.… In light of these                        changed circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand to                        FERC to consider the scope of its authority to craft                        appropriate remedies.…                               ...                               Thus we leave the issue of an appropriate remedy for                        FERC to resolve on remand, in light of the much broader                        preemption that we find compared to what FERC assumed.41         39.    Moreover, the Commission issued these orders before Commission staff issued the         headwater benefits determination in January 2012, before the necessity of considering a         remedy for previous state assessments arose, and before it had the language of the 2006         Settlement before it.42 Therefore, the complaint orders cited by Erie Boulevard do not         represent binding precedent that prevents the Commission from giving the 2006         Settlement equitable consideration.                        3.     The District’s arguments regarding the 2006 Settlement do not                               amount to an untimely, collateral attack on the July 2012 Order.         40.    Erie Boulevard argues the District should have raised the issue of the 2006         Settlement in response to the 2009 Remand Order or in a timely request for rehearing of         the July 2012 Order rather than in its November 13, 2012 filing.43 It contends that the         July 2012 Order indicated the intent to provide credits for all downstream beneficiaries                41                   548 F.3d 1071, 1079-81.                42                   Albany Engineering attached to its rehearing request the District’s press release         regarding 2006 Settlement—not a copy of the settlement itself. See Albany Engineering         January 22, 2007 Rehearing Request at 18 n.7 (“[Albany Engineering] has not yet been         able to acquire the text of the entire state court settlement.”).                43                   Erie Boulevard Rehearing Request at 26-28. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 15 -         without exception.44 Erie Boulevard elaborates that the July 2012 Order put the District         on notice that the Commission intended to credit Erie Boulevard for all of its         overpayments to the District.         41.     Erie Boulevard misstates the extent of the determinations made in the July 2012         Order. The substantive issues resolved in the order addressed comments filed in response         to the draft headwater benefits report, and calculated headwater benefits for the basin.         The July 2012 Order resolved those issues, and arrived at a section 10(f) “interest,         maintenance, and depreciation” determination, but concluded that additional information         needed to be collected from all parties—not just from the downstream beneficiaries, but         also from the District. Until such time as the Commission had all the facts before it, it         could not make a final determination on these matters.         42.     The 2009 Remand Order recognized only that the Commission “may in the future         consider whether it is appropriate to offset any amounts Albany Engineering owes the         District to account for payments it has already made.\"45 On rehearing of the 2009         Remand Order, the Commission again acknowledged only that, at the conclusion of a         headwater benefits investigation, it “may be able to consider offsetting future charges by         amounts that have already been paid.”46 Moreover, the July 2012 Order recognized that         “downstream project owners may already have obtained refunds from the District         through court action or other means” and that “in any headwater benefits determination         done for the basin, [the Commission] could take into account such refunds….”47 It is         within this context that the July 2012 Order sought additional information.         43.     The Commission contemplated collecting information, not only regarding         previous assessments, but also regarding “any funds that may have since been returned to         the downstream licensees.”48 In response to the July 2012 Order’s request for additional         information, and after the parties failed to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, Erie                 44                    See July 2012 Order, 140 FERC ¶ 62,089 at P 44 (“Moreover, to the extent that,         while the Great Sacandaga Lake Project has been under license, any of the downstream         project owners made payments exceeding the amounts that this order finds were owed for         those years, those overpayments, equitably, should be offset against future charges.”).                 45                    See 2009 Remand Order, 127 FERC ¶ 61,174 at P 3.                 46                    2009 Remand Rehearing Order, 129 FERC ¶ 61,134 at P 31.                 47                    Id. P 45 and n.18.                 48                    July 2012 Order, 140 FERC ¶ 62,089 at P 48. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                 - 16 -         Boulevard filed information regarding its previous state law assessments, and the District         filed additional information highlighting the unique circumstances with respect to Erie         Boulevard, i.e. the provisions of the 2006 Settlement. The Commission resolved these         issues in the August 2015 Order, and it is then that the issue became ripe for rehearing.         44.     In support, Erie Boulevard cites New York Independent System Operator, Inc.49         and Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.50 However, these cases do not help Erie Boulevard.         Unlike the situation here, in those cases the Commission had made an explicit finding on         a specific issue. As explained above, the issue of how to treat Erie’s payments to the         District under the 2006 Settlement only arose as a result of the request in the July 2012         Order for additional information.51 Thus, the facts of these proceedings do not fit within         the rule set forth in the cases cited by Erie Boulevard.         45.     For the above reasons, we deny rehearing on this issue.                        4.      The determination to give effect to the 2006 Settlement language                                was not arbitrary and capricious.         46.     Erie Boulevard avers that the August 2015 order was not based on substantial         evidence, and was in fact contrary to all the evidence in the record. Erie Boulevard states         that, by relying on the 2006 Settlement to deprive it of credits for its past payments, the         August 2015 Order ignored the Commission’s January 19, 2012 draft headwater benefits         determination report. Erie Boulevard reasons that the denial of credits forces it         essentially to pay headwater benefits that exceed the section 10(f) amount determined in         the January 2012 draft report and in the July 2012 Order.         47.     The August 2015 Order did not ignore the January 19, 2012 draft report. The         August 2015 Order relied on the draft report for the purpose of concluding that Erie         Boulevard had made sufficient payments to the District for the 2002 through 2008 time         period to satisfy amounts determined pursuant to section 10(f). It is known that Erie         Boulevard made sufficient payments to satisfy these section 10(f) amounts because the                 49                    135 FERC ¶ 61,170, at P 105 (2011).                 50                    105 FERC ¶ 61,120, at P 5 (2003).                 51                    The July 2012 Order specifically found not only that it did not have the         necessary information to incorporate previous state assessments but also that there may         be special circumstances whereby “downstream project owners may already have         obtained refunds from the District through court action or other means.” July 2012         Order, 140 FERC ¶ 62,089 at P 45. 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 17 -         state assessments Erie Boulevard had paid for this same time period exceeded the         section 10(f) amounts determined in the January 19, 2012 draft report and in the July         2012 Order. These proceedings have simply used Erie Boulevard’s previous state         assessments as credits against the section 10(f) amount determined in the July 2012         Order, thereby not requiring Erie Boulevard to make double payments for this time         period. However, with respect to the excess payments Erie Boulevard had made pursuant         to state law—where other equities such as the 2006 Settlement come into play—the         Commission has determined that crediting Erie Boulevard for these excess payments is         not appropriate based on the bargain it struck in that settlement. These determinations,         therefore, in no way mean that the August 2015 Order was not based on substantial         evidence.                         5.    Reliance on the 2006 Settlement is consistent with FPA section                               10(f).         48.     Erie Boulevard argues the August 2015 Order’s reliance on the 2006 Settlement to         deny Erie Boulevard credits is inconsistent with the FPA and Commission regulations.         Erie Boulevard contends, while the section 10(f) study determined Erie Boulevard’s share         of “interest, maintenance, and depreciation,” the state assessments included not only         “interest, maintenance, and depreciation” but also included expenses such as capital and         operating expenses. Erie Boulevard states that Commission staff failed to explain how it         could rely on the 2006 Settlement to eliminate future offsets when clearly the 2006         Settlement could not have been approved under FPA section 10(f). Erie Boulevard adds         that Commission staff erred in relying on the 2006 Settlement because it had not been         submitted to the Commission for approval under Rule 602 of the Commission’s Rules of         Practice and Procedure.52         49.     In the remand orders, the Commission was clear that the District’s collection of         state headwater benefits assessments was not a violation of the District’s license, and was         not a violation of the FPA. The July 2012 Order determined section 10(f) amounts for         “interest, maintenance, and depreciation” and the August 2015 Order ensured that Erie         Boulevard has made sufficient payments to the District to cover these amounts, while at         the same time recognizing the bargain struck between Erie Boulevard and the District.         Given the equities at stake, the Commission considers amounts Erie Boulevard paid that         exceed the amount determined pursuant to section 10(f) to have been settled by the 2006         Settlement. As the Commission has said throughout these proceedings, Erie Boulevard’s         remedies for anything in excess of the section 10(f) amount determined in the July 2012         Order lie in state court.                 52                    18 C.F.R. § 385.602 (2015). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                 - 18 -                         6.     The August 2015 Order did not give effect to state law                                assessments that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had found to                                be preempted.         50.     Erie Boulevard argues Commission staff’s treatment of the 2006 Settlement         inappropriately resurrected state law assessments that Albany Engineering had found to         be preempted. The company emphasizes the statements by the D.C. Circuit Court of         Appeals that the state headwater benefits assessment scheme has been totally preempted.         Erie Boulevard argues that Commission staff did not explain why the District is entitled         to be “unjustly enriched” by the state law payments.         51.     As explained above, the Commission concludes that the August 2015 Order did         not violate the FPA. Similarly, nothing about the August 2015 Order resurrects the state         scheme and nothing about the August 2015 Order is contrary to Albany Engineering.         Erie Boulevard’s remedy for the excess lies in state court—a point the Commission made         in the 2009 Remand Order and 2009 Remand Rehearing Order.53                         7.     The August 2015 Order treated Erie Boulevard equitably.         52.     Erie Boulevard argues that denying it equitable relief was particularly         inappropriate in light of the fact that only it and Albany Engineering had provided the         District with timely notice of objections to the state law assessments. The company         bolsters its argument by assuming the August 2015 Order’s rationale for treating Erie         Boulevard differently from other downstream licensees was that Erie Boulevard should         have joined its preemption claim with its other claims in the proceeding that culminated         in the 2006 Settlement.54                 53                    2009 Remand Order, 127 FERC ¶ 61,174 at P 41 (“For these reasons, we         continue to believe that, if Albany Engineering insists on obtaining a refund of the         payments, rather than a remedy that we can provide, it should do so through a court         action.”); 2009 Remand Rehearing Order, 129 FERC ¶ 61,134 at P 32 (“We continue to         believe that any further responsibility to address continuing unauthorized acts taken by         the District or by the counties, or to seek refunds of payments solicited by the District         through its reliance on state law, lies with Albany Engineering itself, armed with the         court's preemption finding.”)                 54                    Erie Boulevard Rehearing Request at 35 (“Finally, to the extent Staff’s rationale         for treating Erie differently than the seven other downstream licensees is that Erie should         have brought a preemption claim while challenging the District’s assessment of charges         under the New York ECL . . ., Erie notes that, except for Albany, none of the other                                                                                        (continued ...) 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 19 -         53.    We disagree. The key to why the August 2015 Order treated Erie Boulevard         differently from the other seven downstream beneficiaries (not including Albany         Engineering) is that Erie Boulevard settled its disagreements with the District and in         doing so, agreed to a very broad release of future claims based on facts then in existence.         Given this factual distinction, Erie Boulevard’s treatment in the August 2015 Order was         equitable.                        8.     Erie Boulevard is correct that the August 2015 Order should be                               revised to provide an offset for payments it made on behalf of                               the Glens Falls Project, which was not part of the 2006                               Settlement.         54.    Erie Boulevard maintains that the August 2015 Order’s denial of credits for past         payments to the District erroneously included the Glens Falls Project No. 2385, which         was not part of the 2006 Settlement. The company states that it did not become the         owner of the Glens Falls project until August 2007—fourteen months after the 2006         Settlement.         55.    Erie Boulevard is correct. The August 2015 Order mistakenly included the Glens         Falls Project among those Erie Boulevard projects subject to the 2006 Settlement, and         rehearing is granted on this point. Erie Boulevard states that, while under its ownership,         the District assessed the Glens Falls Project $139,769.51 in 2007 and 2008 ($279,539.02         for both years), which Erie Boulevard paid. The project’s section 10(f) assessments for         the same time period were $51,741 and $66,547, respectively, for a total of $118,288.         Because the Glens Falls Project No. 2385 was not part of the 2006 Settlement, and         because Erie Boulevard paid $161,251 more than the District was due under         section 10(f), we will allow this overpayment to offset section 10(f) assessments of         $66,547 for future years.         56.    By including the Glens Falls Project among Erie Boulevard’s projects, the August         2015 Order also omitted the Glens Falls Project from its Table 3, which calculated the         offsets. Correction of this error raises yet another issue of material concern which         requires correction. Erie Boulevard provides information on amounts it has paid the         District beginning in 2007 when the license was transferred to its subsidiary. It also gives         estimates of the amounts paid by the prior licensee of the Glens Falls Project. To the         extent there were overpayments before the license was transferred to Erie Boulevard’s         subsidiary in 2007, they were made by the prior licensee. Under these circumstances, we         will not provide an offset to Erie Boulevard for payments made by a third party. By the         downstream licensees challenged the District’s [New York Environmental Conservation         Law] assessments on § 10(f) grounds until 2012.”). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015          Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                                                                      - 20 -          same token, we will not hold the present licensee responsible for assessments for those          past years.          57.

With the exception of a slight         rounding discrepancy, the amounts in the revised tables for the Erie Boulevard licensed         projects (E.J. West, Stewart’s Bridge, Hudson River, and Feeder Dam) and FH Opco’s         project (Glens Falls) equal the amounts in the corresponding tables from the July 2012         Order under “Erie Boulevard.”         61.     We are modifying Ordering Paragraph (B) of the August 2015 Order such that the         interim assessments, which begin July 1, 2009, are specified for each of the beneficiary         projects.                        9.     The August 2015 Order properly did not provide for interest in                               its calculations.         62.     Erie Boulevard contends that Commission staff erroneously denied interest when         providing credits for state assessments. The company states the August 2015 Order         inappropriately conflated concepts when it compared illegal past state assessments with         past FPA 10(f) assessments, where no interest is awarded. Erie Boulevard emphasizes         how awarding interest will make the downstream beneficiaries whole by accounting for         the time value of money. Erie Boulevard also points out that a court would have awarded         interest as a matter of course, as exemplified by the outcome from the Albany 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                - 22 -         Engineering’s proceeding in state court. Finally, Erie Boulevard states the failure to         award interest penalizes Erie Boulevard in favor of those who sought relief in New York         state court.         63.     The Commission does not compute interest in headwater benefits cases where         licensees are assessed headwater benefits retroactively, where the same time value of         money arguments would be applicable. The Commission’s regulations contain formulas         for determining section 10(f) amounts,55 and none of these provisions call for calculation         of interest. Indeed, throughout these proceedings, Erie Boulevard has never requested         that the Commission calculate interest on the section 10(f) amounts going back to 2002         determined in the July 2012 Order. The Commission calculated a section 10(f) amount         for Erie Boulevard for the years 2002 through 2008, for which Erie Boulevard was given         credit for its previous state law assessments. The Commission does not award interest for         the past assessments, and finds that it would be inequitable to award interest for the past         state law assessments but not for the section 10(f) amounts. Similarly, assessments going         forward are not adjusted to account for inflation. Moreover, in a future headwater         benefits study, when interim assessments are made final, Commission regulations         similarly do not provide for the calculation of interest.56 Accordingly, the August 2015         Order properly determined that interest should not be applied to credits for previous state         assessments.                         10.    Conclusion         64.     The remand orders (2009 Remand Order and 2009 Remand Rehearing Order)         concluded that Albany Engineering confused the authority to preempt with the authority         to order refunds. Similarly, Erie Boulevard now confuses the preemption issue with what         it considers an obligation of the Commission to grant it a remedy for assessments made         under color of state law that neither violated a Commission license nor the FPA. Nothing         in the court’s decision or the remand orders suggests that giving equitable consideration         to the 2006 Settlement results in a violation of the FPA, the Commission’s own         regulations, and the mandate of Albany Engineering. The Commission has simply         attempted herein to craft an equitable solution that both avoids calling on Erie Boulevard         to make double payment and takes into account additional considerations such as the         2006 Settlement. Accordingly, with the exception of the issues discussed above         involving Glens Falls, Erie Boulevard’s rehearing request is denied.                 55                    See 18 C.F.R. § 11.10 et seq. (2015).                 56                    See, e.g., Wausau Paper Mills, et al., 144 FERC ¶ 62,058 (2013). 20151119-3059 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 11/19/2015         Docket No. HB81-09-2-003, et al.                                                  - 23 -                B.      Boralex Companies Rehearing Request         65.    On rehearing, the Boralex Companies argue that the August 2015 Order failed to         provide similar treatment for similarly-situated licensees. The Boralex Companies         explain that the August 2015 Order aggregated overpayments for purposes of calculating         the break-even date for Erie Boulevard’s five projects (E.J. West, Stewart’s Bridge,         Hudson River Project, and Feeder Dame) and FH Opco’s project (Glens Falls), which are         all under the common ownership of a common parent company, Brookfield Renewable         Energy Group, but did not aggregate overpayments for the Boralex Companies’ projects         (South Glens Falls and Hudson Falls) to determine their “break-even” date.         66.    The clarifications above change the landscape for approaching the Boralex         Companies’ rehearing request. The August 2015 Order erroneously included the Glens         Falls Project with Erie Boulevard’s projects subject to the 2006 Settlement, and also         omitted Glens Falls from the table calculating commencement of section 10(f)         assessments. This order corrects that omission by determining a separate date for         commencement of headwater benefits assessments for the Glens Falls Project.         67.    Given these modifications and clarifications, it is clear that no party to these         proceedings received a benefit from aggregating numbers, and no party was harmed from         aggregating numbers. The combined presentation of the numbers for Erie Boulevard’s         projects and the FH Opco’s project was meant to simplify the orders, and was not meant         to confer any benefit or detriment to Erie Boulevard or any of the other parties to these         proceedings. Each project involved in these proceedings has a separate headwater benefit         obligation independent of the others, and the same is true for the Boralex Companies.         Accordingly, rehearing is denied.                C.      Albany Engineering’s Request for Clarification         68.    On September 30, 2015, Albany Engineering filed a request for clarification as to         whether commencing payment of headwater benefits should precede resolution of the         pending requests for rehearing.         69.    The order was effective upon issuance, and the filing of a request for rehearing         does not operate as a stay of the order’s effective date. 57                57                   August 2015 Order, 152 FERC ¶ 62,124 at ordering para.

On October 5, and 19, 2015, respectively, Erie Boulevard and the Boralex         Companies filed motions for stay of the August 2015 Order pending our action on their         requests for rehearing. The District filed answers opposing Erie Boulevard’s and the         Boralex Companies’ motions for stay on October 20 and 21, 2015, respectively. This         order acts on the requests for rehearing, and the motions for stay are therefore dismissed         as moot.         The Commission orders:                (A) The Erie Boulevard Hydropower, L.P. rehearing request filed on         September 21, 2015, is granted in part and denied in part.

ORDER DENYING COMPLAINT                                           (Issued January 30, 2015)         1.      On November 26, 2014, Exelon Corporation and Calpine Corporation         (Complainants) filed a complaint against ISO New England Inc. (ISO-NE) pursuant to         sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act (FPA),1 alleging that certain provisions of         ISO-NE’s Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff (Tariff) relevant to the Forward         Capacity Market (FCM) are unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory.         Specifically, Complainants challenge the Tariff provisions that require new entrants         electing to “lock-in” the clearing price from the first Forward Capacity Auction (FCA) in         which they clear to submit what are, in effect, zero-price offers into subsequent FCAs         during the relevant lock-in period. Complainants allege that the provisions result in         unjust and unreasonable price suppression and are unduly discriminatory. Complainants         request that the Commission remedy the impacts of this price suppression on other         suppliers and the market consistent with the approach taken in the PJM Interconnection,         L.L.C. (PJM) market with respect to its New Entry Price Adjustment (NEPA). In this         order, we find that Complainants have not shown that the Tariff rules requiring zero-price         offers result in unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory price suppression, and thus         we deny the complaint.                 1                   16 U.S.C. §§ 824(e), 825(e) (2012). 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                            -2-         I.      Background         2.      ISO-NE administers the FCM, in which eligible resources compete in annual         FCAs, to provide capacity three years in advance of the relevant capacity commitment         period. To determine the amount of capacity that ISO-NE needs to procure in an         FCA, the New England region is modeled both as a whole, i.e., as the system-wide         New England Control Area, and as a collection of distinct zones, known as Capacity         Zones.         3.      Although the FCA is intended to produce a single Capacity Clearing Price for all         cleared resources, under certain conditions the prices paid to cleared resources may be         administratively determined by ISO-NE and differ based on whether a resource is new or         existing. One instance in which prices would be administratively determined occurs         when the Capacity Carry Forward Rule2 is triggered. This can occur when some but not         all of a new resource’s offered capacity is needed in an FCA and that resource elects not         to prorate its offered capacity down to the level needed, resulting in the resource’s excess         capacity being carried forward into the subsequent FCA. When the Capacity Carry         Forward Rule is triggered, the Capacity Clearing Price for the relevant Capacity Zone is         the lesser of the following: (1) $0.01 below the price at which the last New Generating         Capacity Resource, New Import Capacity Resource, or New Demand Resource in the         Capacity Zone withdrew from the FCA; or (2) the applicable net Cost of New Entry         (Net CONE) value.3         4.      Relevant here, the Capacity Commitment Period Election provision of the Tariff4         can affect the administrative prices paid to existing resources. Under that provision, a         new resource offering capacity into the FCM must specify whether, if its new capacity         offer clears in the FCA, the associated Capacity Supply Obligation and Capacity Clearing         Price (indexed for inflation) shall continue to apply after the Capacity Commitment         Period associated with the FCA in which the offer clears, for up to six additional and         consecutive Capacity Commitment Periods (this option is referred to here as “New         Entrant Pricing”).5 The Tariff allows a new entrant to lock in the first auction clearing                 2                   ISO-NE Tariff section III.13.2.7.9.                 3                   The Tariff defines Net CONE as the estimated gross cost of entry for a new         capacity resource net of revenues from energy, reserve, and other markets. Id.         section I.2.2.                 4                   Id. section III.13.1.1.2.2.4.                 5                   Id. Prior to June 1, 2014, the price lock-in period was five years. However, by         order issued May 30, 2014, the Commission accepted ISO-NE’s proposal to extend the         lock-in period to seven years. ISO New England, Inc. and New England Power Pool         Participants Committee, 147 FERC ¶ 61,173, at P 54 (2014) (reh’g pending). 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                              -3-         price for up to six additional auctions in order to mitigate price risk. If a new resource         elects New Entrant Pricing, the resource may not submit any type of de-list or export bid         in subsequent FCAs for Capacity Commitment Periods for which the resource owner         elected to have the New Entrant Pricing apply.6 In other words, in order to lock-in the         first-year price, the Tariff requires that the capacity be offered as a price-taker (i.e., at a         zero-price offer) in all future years for which it receives the first-year capacity price.         Thus, FCM revenues for the new entrant are guaranteed during the lock-in period         regardless of whether capacity clearing prices in subsequent auctions over that period         exceed or fall short of the initial FCM clearing price.         5.      In October 2013, the New England Power Generators Association (NEPGA) filed         a complaint, in Docket No. EL14-7-000, against ISO-NE challenging certain of the         administrative pricing mechanisms applicable in the then-upcoming eighth FCA for the         2017/2018 Commitment Period (FCA 8), including the Capacity Carry Forward Rule. In         concurrently-issued orders dated January 24, 2014, the Commission granted NEPGA’s         complaint in part, but denied the complaint as it related to the Capacity Carry Forward         Rule.7 In the NEPGA Complaint Order, the Commission reasoned that carrying forward         the capacity from a resource with a multi-year price lock-in will not necessarily suppress         prices below competitive levels because there is not necessarily a link between the         capacity carried forward in a zone and the amount of excess capacity remaining in that         zone.8 In response to NEPGA’s argument that ISO-NE’s zero-price offer requirement is         inconsistent with the Commission’s rejection of zero-price offers in PJM, the order noted         that ISO-NE’s and PJM’s tariffs differed substantially at the time, including, most         importantly, PJM’s use of a sloped demand curve.9 The Commission also directed         ISO-NE to submit a sloped demand curve by April 1, 2014, to allow sufficient time for         implementation prior to FCA 9.10         6.      On May 30, 2014, in Docket No. ER14-1639-000, the Commission accepted,         subject to condition, ISO-NE’s proposal to implement a system-wide sloped demand                 6                   ISO-NE Tariff section III.13.1.1.2.2.4.                 7                   New England Power Generators Association, Inc. v.

II.     The Complaint         7.      Complainants state that failure to address the price-suppressing effect of the         New Entry Pricing Rule makes the existing FCM rules unjust, unreasonable and unduly         discriminatory, and request that the Commission address the impact of the lock-in when         coupled with the zero-price offer requirement on other suppliers, consistent with the         approach taken in PJM. Complainants argue that both the price lock-in itself and the         zero-price offer requirement unreasonably and artificially suppress capacity prices and         result in undue discrimination because new entrants are paid higher prices than are paid         to other resources for providing the same capacity services. They further argue that the         price lock-in suppresses the clearing price in the entry FCA because new entrants will         offer at an artificially low price knowing that they will receive up to six additional         installment payments in subsequent FCAs. Complainants state that they are not asking         the Commission to eliminate the New Entry Pricing Rule, but rather only to remedy the         impacts of the resulting price suppression on other suppliers and the market by         implementing either an approach consistent with that taken in PJM, or an alternative         remedy such as offering some type of lock-in option to existing resources as well.         8.      Complainants state that the Commission acknowledged the price-suppressing         effect of the New Entry Pricing Rule when it approved the extension of the lock-in         period, where the Commission stated that the rule “may result in lower market clearing         prices.”12 Complainants state that the price suppression is artificial because without the         seven-year lock-in, a new entrant would have required a much higher payment in year         one to compensate for its view of likely market payments in years two through seven.         9.      Complainants argue the Commission consistently has recognized that existing and         new suppliers are similarly situated with respect to capacity markets and thus both should         receive the same price so that price signals are not skewed in favor of new entry,13 but         that the FCM rules treat these similarly situated suppliers differently by allowing new         entrants to lock-in pricing, resulting in undue discrimination.         10.     Complainants assert that the Commission already has determined, in the context of         PJM’s NEPA rule, that treating price-locked resources as price-takers is unjust,                 11                    ISO New England, Inc. and New England Power Pool Participants Committee,         147 FERC ¶ 61,173 (2014) (Demand Curve Order) (reh’g pending).                 12                    Complaint at 11 (citing Demand Curve Order, 147 FERC ¶ 61,173 at P 56).                 13                    Complaint at 11 (citing PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 128 FERC ¶ 61,157, at         P 102 (2009) (PJM Order)). 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                            -5-         unreasonable and unduly discriminatory. Complainants explain that, under PJM’s NEPA         rule, an eligible new entrant may lock-in the clearing price for two additional         commitment periods, and further explain that PJM provides a mechanism to address the         price-suppressing effects of the NEPA rule. Specifically, Complainants state that under         the PJM Tariff, a price-locked resource is required to offer its capacity into the two         subsequent Base Residual Auctions (analogous to an FCA) at a price “equal to the lesser         of A) the price in such seller’s Sell Offer for the BRA in which such resource qualified         [for the lock-in]; or B) 0.90 times the Net CONE applicable in the first BRA in which …         [it] cleared ….”14         11.     Complainants state that the differences between the PJM and ISO-NE Tariffs that         the Commission relied upon in the earlier NEPGA complaint proceeding noted above are         no longer valid.15 In particular, Complainants note that ISO-NE will implement a sloped         demand curve in FCA 9, thus removing what they believe to be the major difference         between the two capacity markets.         12.     At the same time, Complainants state that there are two noteworthy differences         between ISO-NE’s New Entry Pricing rule and PJM’s NEPA. First, the lock-in period in         ISO-NE’s program is seven years, versus three years in PJM, and second, ISO-NE’s         lock-in option is generally available to any new entrant while PJM’s lock-in applies only         in narrow circumstances and thus is rarely triggered. These differences, according to         Complainants, result in greater price suppression under ISO-NE’s New Entry Pricing         Rule than under PJM’s NEPA mechanism. Additionally, Complainants assert that         because the Capacity Carry Forward Rule will not be triggered in FCA 9, and is slated for         elimination in FCA 10, that mechanism will not provide a remedy for price suppression.

On December 16, 2014, ISO-NE filed an answer to the complaint. On         December 31, 2014, Complainants filed an answer to ISO-NE’s answer.                 A.      ISO-NE’s Answer         16.     ISO-NE argues that the complaint raises issues that are duplicative of those raised         in other proceedings currently before the Commission, specifically the requests for         rehearing in the NEPGA Complaint Order and Demand Curve Order proceedings.         ISO-NE states that Complainants’ attempt to distinguish their complaint from these         existing proceedings, as required under Rule 206(b)(6),18 is unconvincing, noting that         the issue of eliminating the price suppressing effects of the lock-in provision and the         zero-price offer requirement was raised on rehearing in both proceedings. ISO-NE         argues that Complainants fail to support their assertion that changes in fact have occurred         since FCA 8 that materially alter the analysis with respect to FCA 9. ISO-NE also states         that Complainants have failed to explain, as also required under Rule 206(b)(6), why         timely resolution of their concern cannot be achieved in those other proceedings, arguing         that the Commission cannot dispose of those proceedings without addressing the sole         issued raised in the instant complaint. Thus, ISO-NE concludes, the complaint is simply         an untimely supplement to prior rehearing requests.         17.     ISO-NE further states that Complainants have not demonstrated, as required under         FPA section 206, that the existing rules are unjust and unreasonable. Contrary to         Complainants’ assertions, ISO-NE states, the Commission has not found that the                 16                    NRG Power Marketing LLC, and GenOn Energy Management, LLC.                 17                    PSEG Power LLC, PSEG Power LLC, PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC,         PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC, PSEG Power Connecticut LLC, and PSEG         Power Connecticut LLC.                 18                    18 C.F.R. § 385.206(b)(6) (2014). 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                                -7-         zero-price offer requirement causes price suppression. Rather, ISO-NE argues, the         Commission has recognized that the zero-price offer requirement may lower clearing         prices, which is not synonymous with price suppression. ISO-NE states that the         Commission’s statement, taken in context, explicitly reaches the opposite conclusion         from what Complainants assert. In other words, ISO-NE states, the Commission         expressly approved the extended lock-in period as just and reasonable while         acknowledging the possibility of lower market clearing prices, which refutes arguments         that the lock-in suppresses prices.         18.     ISO-NE explains that lower prices in a year in which a resource locks in its         capacity price is an intended result because the price stability provided by the lock-in         allows the resource to be offered without an excessive risk premium and closer to its true         competitive cost of entry. ISO-NE adds that, while any price suppression in subsequent         years of the lock-in theoretically could be economically inefficient, such price         suppression is unlikely to occur because a well-designed and efficient new resource is         unlikely to submit a de-list bid at a price higher than the auction clearing price during its         first seven years of operation.         19.     ISO-NE states that Complainants’ reliance on PJM precedent to establish that the         zero-price offer requirement is unjust and unreasonable is misplaced. Specifically,         ISO-NE states that the Commission has rejected attempts to extend the PJM Order’s         holding to the ISO-NE capacity market, including in light of the changed circumstances         of implementation of a sloped demand curve in ISO-NE. ISO-NE states that         Complainants ignore the Commission’s explanations in the NEPGA Complaint Order and         Demand Curve Order that distinguish the ISO-NE and PJM capacity markets.         20.     ISO-NE further argues that the PJM lock-in rules have the same effect as requiring         locked-in resources to offer at zero. ISO-NE continues, explaining that, although the         PJM rules require a resource that has elected a price lock-in under NEPA to offer its         capacity during the lock-in period at the lower of its initial clearing price or 90 percent of         Net CONE, if the resource does not clear at this offer price, its offer is resubmitted at a         lower price so that it does clear, which the complaint does not acknowledge. ISO-NE         states that reducing the offer of a locked-in resource until it clears would have an         identical effect as offering the resource at zero. However, according to ISO-NE, if PJM’s         lock-in rules worked as represented in the complaint, in other words, the offers were not         reduced if they did not initially clear, it would result in difficulties, particularly related to         what to do with a locked-in resource that does not clear, such as how to address the         resource’s Capacity Supply Obligation.         21.     ISO-NE also disputes the efficacy of Complainants’ alternative proposals, stating         that they would exacerbate the harms Complainants allege and would create additional         problems, including introducing significant market power concerns. Finally, ISO-NE         states that, even if the Commission were to grant the requested relief, it would be         impossible to implement the necessary Tariff, process, and software changes for the         upcoming FCA 9. 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                            -8-                 B.     Protests and Comments         22.     CT PURA, Public Systems, and NESCOE protest the complaint, arguing that the         complaint is a collateral attack on the recent Commission order accepting the sloped         demand curve and related rules at issue. These parties further state that Complainants         failed to show that the existing Tariff is unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory,         or that the Complainants’ proposed remedies are just and reasonable and not unduly         discriminatory.         23.     NEPOOL states that the Commission has approved the rules for FCA 9, the issues         raised in the complaint are not new, and thus, in order to prevail here, Complainants must         show that sufficient changes have occurred since the Commission considered and         rejected similar arguments.         24.     EPSA and Entergy Nuclear generally support the complaint, reiterating the         arguments contained therein, and request that the Commission address the unjust,         unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory impact of the New Entry Pricing Rule when         combined with the zero-price offer requirement.                 C.     Answer to Answer         25.     Complainants argue that ISO-NE and others are incorrect in suggesting that the         complaint is a collateral attack on, or procedurally barred by, prior Commission orders.         Complainants restate their position that there have been material changes in         circumstances since those orders were issued that invalidate the bases upon which the         Commission distinguished PJM precedent. Complainants also state that efforts to         distinguish the PJM precedent are inapposite.         26.     Complainants argue that ISO-NE has not adequately supported its economic         theories with evidence, and that ISO-NE has failed to rebut Complainants’ hard evidence         in the form of sworn testimony by the Complainants’ expert witness. Complainants also         state that ISO-NE mischaracterized PJM’s NEPA as having the same effect as ISO-NE’s         zero-price offer requirement. Specifically, Complainants state that the PJM NEPA would         never have the same effect as a zero-price offer requirement when the price-locked         resource’s offer clears and sets the clearing price. Finally, Complainants state that         ISO-NE failed to support its statement that it would be impossible to implement the         changes Complainants propose in time for FCA 9, and suggest that even if the         Commission agrees with ISO-NE, it is essential that the Commission act on the complaint         in order to implement changes prior to the subsequent Capacity Commitment Period. 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                             -9-         IV.     Commission Determination                 A.     Procedural Matters         27.     Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,         18 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2014), the notices of intervention and timely, unopposed motions to         intervene serve to make the entities that filed them parties to this proceeding.         28.     Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,         18 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2) (2014), prohibits an answer to an answer or protest unless         otherwise ordered by the decisional authority. We accept Complainants’ answer because         it provided information that assisted us in our decision-making process.                 B.     Substantive Matters         29.     We deny the complaint. As discussed below, we find that Complainants have not         met their burden under section 206 of the FPA to show that the challenged rules are         unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory. The instant complaint raises many of         the same issues as presented in the NEPGA complaint in Docket No. EL14-7-000, which         we denied in part as noted above, and whose request for rehearing we are denying in a         separate order issuing concurrently with the instant order.19         30.     As we state in that rehearing order, a competitive offer into the FCM would reflect         the going-forward costs of the resource. When each resource offers to supply capacity at         its going-forward costs, the auction can select the set of resources with the lowest costs         and reject the set of resources with the highest costs, so that capacity is procured at the         lowest total cost. A resource whose construction has recently been completed, and that         has accepted a price lock-in, typically has very low going-forward costs. It is efficient         for such a resource to offer as a price-taker (effectively submitting a $0 price offer),         because it is efficient for such a resource to be selected in the auction over resources with         higher going-forward costs.         31.     Much of Complainants’ argument as to why ISO-NE’s current Tariff is unjust and         unreasonable focuses on the fact that ISO-NE’s requirement that a lock-in resource must         offer as a price-taker is inconsistent with PJM’s Commission-approved offer price         requirements for lock-in resources. We agree with Complainants that under certain         limited circumstances, PJM’s NEPA rules may result in higher prices than those under         ISO-NE’s zero-price offer requirement. However, while the Commission has found         PJM’s rules to be just and reasonable, we find that the Complainants have not shown         ISO-NE’s zero-price offer requirement to be unjust and unreasonable, for the reasons         discussed below.                 19                    New England Power Generators Association v. ISO New England Inc.,         150 FERC ¶ 61,064 (2015) 20150130-3053 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/30/2015         Docket No. EL15-23-000                                                            - 10 -         32.     In both ISO-NE and PJM, the capacity offered by a new resource that opts for the         lock-in feature may, in its first auction, simultaneously be the marginal resource and have         less than its full offered capacity clear the market. The mechanisms at issue here relate to         how that portion of the resource’s capacity that did not clear initially is treated in future         auctions for purposes of determining the clearing price and the total procured quantity of         capacity. Because Complainants point to the scenario where at least a portion of the         lock-in resource’s capacity clears the future auction at its mandated initial offer price –         and, under PJM’s rules, can set the price that other cleared resources receive – we address         this scenario below.         33.     Under PJM’s rules, if a portion of the lock-in capacity does not clear in future         auctions at the price resulting from the intersection of the supply and demand curves,         PJM procures the uncleared portion out-of-market as additional capacity. By procuring         the uncleared portion out-of-market, PJM ensures that it does not displace any capacity         with lower going-forward costs.         34.     Under ISO-NE’s rules, ISO-NE does not procure additional capacity beyond the         amount indicated by the intersection of the supply and demand curves, while lock-in         capacity must offer as a price-taker at $0. As a result, lock-in capacity, which, as noted         above, is likely to have low going-forward costs, may “displace” existing capacity with         higher going-forward costs. This is an efficient result because it is likely to yield the         lowest total cost for the capacity procured.         35.     Therefore, while we acknowledge that ISO-NE’s and PJM’s differing mechanics         may, in certain limited circumstances, yield different prices paid to existing resources, we         are not persuaded that this difference, in itself, renders ISO-NE’s rules unjust and         unreasonable. As the Commission has recognized, market design and rules need not be         identical among the regions to be just and reasonable, and there can be more than one just         and reasonable rate.20 Despite highlighting a difference between the PJM and ISO-NE                 20                    See, e.g., PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 119 FERC ¶ 61,063 at P 39 (2007)         (“[T]he Commission has permitted different just and reasonable rate designs reflective of         particular system characteristics and stakeholder input.

ISO-NE’s treatment of those resources         simply reflects the design and efficiency advantages that a resource that recently cleared         an FCA as a new resource would be expected to have over the rest of the New England         fleet. In fact, even if such a resource does not have a price lock-in, it would typically         submit a zero-price offer in the ISO-NE market, consistent with its low going-forward         costs and in order to ensure that it is taken in the auction.         36.     For these reasons, we find that Complainants have not met their burden in showing         that ISO-NE’s existing pricing rules governing lock-in capacity are unjust, unreasonable,         and unduly discriminatory.

ORDER DENYING REHEARING                                           (Issued January 7, 2016)         1.      By order issued January 30, 2015,1 the Commission denied Exelon Corporation         and Calpine Corporation’s (Complainants) complaint against ISO New England Inc.         (ISO-NE), filed pursuant to sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act (FPA),2 which         alleged that certain provisions of ISO-NE’s Transmission, Markets and Services Tariff         (Tariff) relevant to the Forward Capacity Market (FCM) were unjust, unreasonable, and         unduly discriminatory.3 Specifically, Complainants challenged the Tariff provisions that         require new entrants electing to “lock-in” the clearing price from the first Forward         Capacity Auction (FCA) in which they clear to submit what are, in effect, zero-price         offers into subsequent FCAs during the relevant lock-in period. Complainants seek         rehearing of the January 30, 2015 Order. As discussed below, we deny rehearing.                 1                   Exelon Corporation and Calpine Corporation v. ISO New England Inc., 150         FERC ¶ 61,067 (2015) (January 30, 2015 Order).                 2                   16 U.S.C. §§ 824(e), 825(e) (2012).                 3                   The FCM rules are set forth in section 13 of Market Rule 1 of ISO-NE’s Tariff.         Capitalized terms used but not defined herein are intended to have the meaning given to         such terms in the Tariff. 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                               -2-         I.       Background         2.       ISO-NE administers the FCM, in which eligible resources compete in annual         FCAs, to provide capacity three years in advance of the relevant capacity commitment         period. Although the FCA is intended to produce a single Capacity Clearing Price for all         cleared resources, under certain conditions the prices paid to cleared resources may be         administratively determined by ISO-NE and differ based on whether a resource is new or         existing. ISO-NE’s new entrant pricing provision (New Entrant Pricing or New Entrant         Pricing Rule) allows a new entrant to lock in the first auction clearing price for up to six         additional auctions in order to mitigate price risk. If a new resource elects New Entrant         Pricing, the resource may not submit any type of de-list or export bid in subsequent FCAs         for Capacity Commitment Periods for which the resource owner elected to have the New         Entrant Pricing apply. In other words, in order to lock-in the first-year price, the Tariff         requires that the capacity be offered as a price-taker (i.e., at a zero-price offer) in all         future years for which it receives the first-year capacity price. Thus, FCM revenues for         the new entrant are guaranteed during the lock-in period regardless of whether capacity         clearing prices in subsequent auctions over that period exceed or fall short of the initial         FCM clearing price.         3.       In their November 26, 2014 Complaint, Complainants argued that the combination         of the price lock-in and the zero-price offer requirement unreasonably and artificially         suppresses capacity prices and results in undue discrimination because new entrants are         paid higher prices than are paid to other resources for providing the same capacity         services. They stated that the price lock-in suppresses the clearing price in the entry         (i.e., year one) FCA because new entrants will offer at an artificially low price knowing         that they will receive up to six additional installment payments in subsequent FCAs, and         that the clearing price will continue to be suppressed in subsequent FCAs due to new         entrants’ submittal of zero-price offers. Complainants noted that they were not asking the         Commission to eliminate the New Entrant Pricing lock-in, or to alter the treatment of new         entrants, but rather to remedy the impacts of the resulting price suppression on other         suppliers and the market.         4.       Complainants further contended that the Commission’s acceptance of the Tariff         revisions without addressing the price-suppressing effect of the New Entry Pricing         provision was inconsistent with the Commission’s rejection of zero-price offers in the         PJM Interconnection L.L.C. (PJM) market with respect to its New Entry Price         Adjustment.4 Complainants stated that the differences between the PJM and ISO-NE         Tariffs that the Commission relied upon in an earlier proceeding to explain its approach         are no longer valid due to changes to the ISO-NE capacity market, including the                  4                    PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., 128 FERC ¶ 61,157, at P 112 (2009) (PJM Order). 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                             -3-         introduction of a sloped demand curve.5 At the same time, Complainants stated that there         are two noteworthy differences between ISO-NE’s New Entry Pricing rule and PJM’s         New Entry Price Adjustment. First, the lock-in period in ISO-NE’s program is seven         years, versus three years in PJM. Second, ISO-NE’s lock-in option is generally available         to any new entrant, while PJM’s lock-in applies only in narrow circumstances and thus is         rarely triggered. These differences, according to Complainants, result in greater price         suppression under ISO-NE’s New Entry Pricing Rule than under PJM’s New Entry Price         Adjustment mechanism.         5.      Complainants requested that the Commission implement either an approach         consistent with that taken in PJM, by requiring new entrants to submit offers higher than         zero in subsequent auctions, or an alternative remedy such as offering some type of lock-         in option to existing resources.         6.      In the January 30, 2015 Order, the Commission denied the Complaint, finding that         Complainants did not meet their burden under section 206 of the FPA to show that the         challenged rules were unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory. The Commission         reasoned that a resource whose construction has recently been completed and that has         accepted a price lock-in typically has very low going-forward costs and would, if         behaving competitively, submit an offer reflecting those costs. The Commission         explained that by offering at a significantly higher price, a resource would risk not being         selected when the market price exceeds the resource’s incremental costs and the resource         could have received a profit. Moreover, the Commission noted, by requiring locked-in         resources to offer near their going-forward costs, the auction can select the set of         resources with the lowest costs. Thus, the Commission concluded, it is efficient for such         a resource to offer as a price-taker (effectively submitting a $0 price offer), because it is         efficient for such a resource to be selected in the auction over resources with higher         going-forward costs.6         7.      The January 30, 2015 Order noted that much of Complainants’ arguments as to         why ISO-NE’s current Tariff is unjust and unreasonable focuses on the inconsistency         between ISO-NE’s requirement that a lock-in resource must offer as a price-taker and         PJM’s Commission-approved offer price requirements for lock-in resources. The         Commission acknowledged that, in certain limited circumstances, PJM’s New Entry         Price Adjustment rules may result in higher prices paid to existing resources than under         ISO-NE’s zero-price offer requirement, but the Commission was not persuaded that this                 5                   See New England Power Generators Ass’n v. ISO New England Inc., 146 FERC         ¶ 61,039, at P 58 (2014), order denying rehearing and clarification, 150 FERC ¶ 61,064         (2015).                 6                   January 30, 2015 Order, 150 FERC ¶ 61,067 at P 30. 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                              -4-         difference, in itself, rendered ISO-NE’s rules unjust and unreasonable. Therefore, the         Commission found that Complainants did not show that ISO-NE’s zero-price offer         requirement was unjust and unreasonable.7         II.     Request for Rehearing         8.      On rehearing, Complainants argue that, in finding that Complainants failed to         satisfy their burden under FPA section 206, the Commission did not provide a reasoned         basis for finding that there is no artificial price suppression in the post-entry FCAs and         also failed to address the Complainants’ arguments regarding artificial price suppression         in the entry FCA.         9.      With respect to the post-entry FCAs, Complainants argue that the Commission         misunderstood and mischaracterized the Complaint. Complainants state that the         Complaint addressed all capacity that is subject to the price lock-in and that must be         offered into subsequent FCAs at a zero-price offer, not just how the portion of the         resource’s capacity that did not clear initially is treated in future auctions for purposes of         determining the clearing price and total quantity of capacity procured, as stated in the         January 30, 2015 Order.         10.     Complainants also contend that the January 30, 2015 Order ignores the reason for         the price-locked resource’s low going forward costs, which, they assert, are a direct result         of the New Entry Pricing Rule that provides price guarantees over the seven-year lock-in         period. Complainants claim that such capacity would not have entered the market absent         the New Entry Pricing Rule, noting that the Commission found, in approving the         extension of the lock-in from five to seven years under the New Entry Pricing Rule, that         the extension was necessary in light of the risk of lack of investment when new capacity         is needed.         11.     In support of their contention that the Commission failed to respond to their         arguments regarding artificial price suppression in the entry FCA, Complainants state         that the testimony of their witness, Mr. Schnitzer, explained that under the proposed         New Entry Pricing rule, a new entrant will offer at an artificially low level knowing that         it will receive up to six additional installment payments in the succeeding FCAs instead         of being paid the entire amount in the first year. Complainants state that this view         of price suppression in the entry FCA is consistent with the Commission’s prior         acknowledgement that extending the price lock-in period from five to seven years may         result in lower market clearing prices. However, Complainants argue, this creates an         unduly discriminatory pricing scheme, where new entrants benefit from installment         payments over the lock-in period while other suppliers do not receive any payment to                 7                   January 30, 2015 Order, 150 FERC ¶ 61,067 at P 31. 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                            -5-         make up for the lower price in the FCA in which the new entrants first cleared.         Complainants’ proposed solution is for existing suppliers in the entry FCA to receive an         option for a similar installment payment.         12.     In addition, Complainants state that the January 30, 2015 Order “completely         ignores” statements in the Complaint asserting that the Capacity Carry Forward Rule will         not provide a remedy for price suppression resulting from the zero-price offer         requirement contained in the New Entry Pricing Rule because the Capacity Carry         Forward Rule will not trigger in FCA 9 and will be eliminated in FCA 10, and thus         questions about that rule’s efficacy are moot.         13.     Finally, Complainants argue that the January 30, 2015 Order is inconsistent with         the PJM Order, and that the Commission failed to explain its departure from that         precedent. Specifically, Complainants argue that the Commission found that PJM’s         proposal to allow zero-price offers from price-locked resources was not just and         reasonable and was unduly discriminatory, while subsequently allowing the same rules to         go into effect in ISO-NE.8 Complainants argue that the Commission cannot avoid its         own precedent by stating that displacement of existing resources by price-locked         resources offering as price-takers is an efficient result. Complainants state that although         capacity price suppression lowers capacity procurement costs in the short run, such price         suppression will raise prices and harm reliability in the long run, which the Commission         has found in other proceedings. Complainants further state that there is no record         evidence, analysis, or consideration of the long-term effects of such price suppression to         support the Commission’s conclusion. Complainants further state that the Commission         failed to address their argument that the zero-price offer requirement in the New Entry         Pricing Rule results in undue discrimination because it creates a two-tiered compensation         system where existing resources receive the FCA clearing price while new entrants that         lock-in their price receive guaranteed additional payments. Complainants argue that the         Commission previously determined in PJM that a zero-price offer requirement would         result in unduly discriminatory pricing because the new entrant would receive its first         year price for all the locked-in years, while existing resources would receive a lower         price.9 Complainants state that the Commission has departed from precedent that found         existing and new resources are similarly situated with respect to capacity markets and         should receive the same price.10                 8                   Request for Rehearing at 14-15 (citing PJM Order, 128 FERC ¶ 61,157 at P 112).                 9                   Id. at 19 (citing PJM Order, 128 FERC ¶ 61,157 at P 112).                 10                    Id. at 20 (citing PJM Order, 128 FERC ¶ 61,157 at P 102). 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                            -6-         III.    Discussion         14.     As discussed below, we deny rehearing.         15.     We disagree with Complainants’ assertion that the Commission failed to provide a         reasoned basis for finding that the New Entry Pricing Rule, coupled with the lock-in         requirement, is just and reasonable and also failed to address the Complainants’         arguments regarding artificial price suppression in the entry FCA. The January 30, 2015         Order found, and we affirm here, that a competitive resource would offer into the         capacity market in years two through seven at its going-forward costs, and that a new         generator typically would have low going-forward costs, approaching zero. As the         Commission explained, the incremental costs for a newly-constructed resource are         typically near zero because new resources need relatively little maintenance to satisfy         their capacity obligations. By allowing sellers to reflect their going-forward costs in their         offers, ISO-NE is able to select the most efficient (lowest cost) set of resources, because         the low offer prices reflect low going-forward costs. These considerations support a         conclusion that the zero-price offer requirement is just and reasonable.         16.     With respect to Complainants’ argument that the lock-in option suppresses         clearing prices in the entry FCA, we acknowledge that the existence of the lock-in option         may result in lower capacity clearing prices than might result absent that option.11 But         we disagree that this amounts to unreasonable price suppression or undue discrimination         between new and existing resources. Rather, any lowering of the entry-FCA clearing         prices is an acceptable byproduct of a just and reasonable market rule—i.e. ISO-NE’s         New Entrant Pricing Rule—that achieves particular and distinct objectives in the region.         As the Commission stated when it accepted ISO-NE’s proposal to extend the lock-in         option from five years to seven years, the lock-in option strikes a reasonable balance         between incenting new entry through greater investor assurance and protecting         consumers from very high prices.12 We therefore affirm our finding that ISO-NE’s         New Entrant Pricing Rule and associated mechanics remain just and reasonable.                 11                    We note that while the Commission concedes the possibility that the lock-in         option may result in lower capacity clearing prices in the entry FCA, capacity sell offers         from new resources remain subject to ISO-NE’s Commission-approved minimum offer         price rule. Absent exemption or a display of going forward costs below defined Offer         Review Trigger Prices (ORTP), new capacity sell offers are limited by the ORTPs, which         the Commission has found to be a just and reasonable rate.

We next turn to Complainants’ assertion that the Commission inappropriately, and         without explanation, departed from precedent by accepting ISO-NE’s requirement that a         resource that has elected to lock-in its clearing price for seven years must offer as a price-         taker, given the Commission’s rejection of a similar proposal in the PJM Order. As noted         above, the January 30, 2015 Order recognized that this argument was central to         Complainants’ case, and acknowledged that, under certain limited circumstances, PJM’s         New Entry Price Adjustment rules may result in higher prices paid to existing resources         than those under ISO-NE’s zero-price offer requirement. The January 30 Order stated,         however, that due to differing clearing mechanics, neither set of rules results in an         inefficient selection of capacity, and therefore both can be just and reasonable.13         18.     Complainants assert that the Commission’s findings in the January 30, 2015 Order         reflect a departure from the PJM Order. As the markets have evolved, so too has the         Commission’s opinion regarding whether zero-price offers from locked-in resources may         be just and reasonable. Based on further consideration, the Commission has realized that         a zero-price capacity offer from a new merchant resource that has cleared in at least one         previous auction and has incurred construction costs can be a competitive offer that         reflects the resource’s going-forward costs, not an attempt to lower capacity market         clearing prices. Once a new resource clears its initial capacity auction (and incurs         significant costs to satisfy that capacity obligation), it has an incentive to ensure that it         clears in subsequent auctions. A zero-price offer strategy is consistent with that         incentive.                 13                    In PJM, a lock-in resource must offer its capacity in two subsequent auctions at         the lesser of: (1) its initial sell offer; or (2) 0.9 times Net CONE in the Locational         Delivery Area. Although the New Entry Price Adjustment rules guarantee revenues for         such a resource for two subsequent years, the offer requirement could result in the         resource clearing a smaller quantity than it cleared initially. If so, the New Entry Price         Adjustment rules detail how the lock-in resource’s capacity will be used to determine the         capacity supply curve and market-clearing prices in the two subsequent auctions. Under         New Entry Price Adjustment, the initial cleared lock-in quantity needed for reliability         will be included in subsequent supply curves as an effective price taker. Additional lock-         in capacity may clear under the offer requirement only if it is lower cost than other         offered capacity resources. New Entry Price Adjustment rules support economic         efficiency by ensuring that previously cleared lock-in capacity clears the auction, thus         recognizing that load has already committed to purchase the lock-in capacity for the         relevant delivery year, and any portion of the lock-in resource’s capacity paid out-of-         market is simply a byproduct of the design of PJM’s New Entry Price Adjustment rules.         See PJM OATT at Attachment DD, sections 5.14(c)(4), 5.14(c)(5)(ii) and 5.14(c)(5)(iii). 20160107-3022 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 01/07/2016         Docket No. EL15-23-001                                                          -8-         19.     Moreover, we note that Complainants’ requested relief—namely that ISO-NE         enter lock-in resources into capacity auctions in years two through seven at higher prices         and purchase uncleared capacity from those resources out-of-market—could have a         significant cost impact on New England customers. The lock-in option is available to         every new resource that clears an auction in ISO-NE. In a scenario where one or more         new ISO-NE resources lock in their prices in year one, and auction clearing prices in         subsequent years drop such that those resources do not clear at the year-one price,         New England customers could incur significant costs to pay the lock-in resources out-of-         market. For these reasons, we reject Complainants’ arguments.         20.     With respect to Complainants’ argument that the Commission failed to address         their argument that the Capacity Carry Forward Rule was an inadequate remedy to price         suppression resulting from the zero-price offer requirement because the rule is now moot,         we note that, contrary to Complainants’ assertion, the Capacity Carry Forward Rule         remains a part of the ISO-NE Tariff at this time. More importantly, as discussed above,         we are denying the Complaint because our approach regarding zero-price offers has         evolved, not because of the existence of this rule.         21.     For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Complainants’ rehearing request.         The Commission orders:                 Complainants’ request for rehearing of the January 30, 2015 Order is hereby         denied, as discussed in the body of this order.

PacifiCorp                                                     Project No. 2082-058                      ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR DECLARATORY ORDER                                            (Issued June 19, 2014)         1.     The Hoopa Valley Tribe (Tribe) has filed a petition for a declaratory order asking         the Commission to find that PacifiCorp, the licensee for the Klamath Hydroelectric         Project No. 2082, has failed to diligently pursue relicensing of the project, dismiss         PacifiCorp’s relicense application, and direct PacifiCorp to file a plan for         decommissioning the project. In the alternative, the Tribe asks the Commission to         declare that the State of California Water Resources Control Board (California Water         Board) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (Oregon DEQ) have         waived their authority to issue water quality certification for the project pursuant to the         Clean Water Act. This order denies the petition.         Background         2.     The 169-megawatt Klamath Project is located principally on the Klamath River         in Klamath County, Oregon and Siskiyou County, California.1 The project includes         seven hydroelectric developments and one non-generating dam.2 The Commission’s         predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, issued a 50-year original license for the         project in 1954. The license expired in 2006 and the project has been operated under         annual license since that time.3         3.     On February 25, 2004, PacifiCorp filed with the Commission an application for         a new license for the Klamath Project. The company proposed to relicense five of the                1                  One development is located on Fall Creek, a tributary to the Klamath.                2                  See Final Environmental Impact Statement for Hydropower License, Klamath         Hydroelectric Project, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Energy         Projects (November 2007) at xxxiii.                3                  See 16 U.S.C. § 808(a)(1) (2012). 20140619-3012 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2014         Project No. 2082-058                                                                -2-         project’s generating developments and to decommission the other three developments,         including the non-generating development. In November 2007, Commission staff issued         a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in the relicensing proceeding.4 Staff         recommended adopting PacifiCorp’s proposal, with the addition of a number of         environmental measures.         4.     On March 5, 2010, PacifiCorp filed with the Commission the Klamath         Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement). The Settlement         Agreement, which was signed by the Governors of the States of California and Oregon,         PacifiCorp, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce’s National         Marine Fisheries Service, several Indian tribes (not including the Hoopa Tribe), and a         number of local counties, irrigators, and conservation and fishing groups, provided for         the future removal of PacifiCorp’s licensed Klamath River dams, with a target date of         2020. The parties did not ask the Commission to act on the agreement, the completion of         which was contingent on the passage of federal legislation and action by the Secretary of         the Interior.         5.     To date, no federal legislation regarding the Settlement Agreement has been         enacted,5 and the parties have not requested Commission action.         6.     Under section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act,6 the Commission may not issue a         license authorizing the construction or operation of a hydroelectric project unless the state         water quality certifying agency has either issued a Water Quality Certification for the         project or has waived certification by failing to act on a request for certification within a         reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year.         7.     PacifiCorp filed a request for water quality certification with the California Water         Board on March 29, 2006. Since then, the company has withdrawn and refiled its         application eight times. Similarly, PacifiCorp filed a request for certification with         Oregon DEQ on March 29, 2006, and has withdrawn and refiled its application eight                4                  See n.2, infra.                5                  On May 21, 2014, Senator Wyden introduced S. 2379, entitled, “A bill to         approve and implement the Klamath Basin agreements, to improve natural resource         management, support economic development, and sustain agricultural production in the         Klamath River Basin in the public interest and the interest of the United States, and for         other purposes.”                6                  33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1) (2012). 20140619-3012 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2014         Project No. 2082-058                                                              -3-         times. In refiling its applications, PacifiCorp has noted that the Settlement Agreement         requires it to do so in order to avoid waiver by the water quality certifying agencies.7         8.      On May 25, 2012, the Tribe filed a petition for a declaratory order, asking the         Commission to find that PacifiCorp has failed to diligently pursue relicensing of the         project and accordingly require the company to file a plan for decommissioning the         project, or, in the alternative, find that California and Oregon have waived water quality         certification and issue a new license for the project.         9.      On June 25, 2012, PacifiCorp, on behalf of itself and 16 other parties, filed an         answer opposing the petition. Also on June 25, 2012, the County of Siskiyou and         Siskiyou County Flood Control and Water Conservation District filed an answer         opposing project decommissioning but urging issuance of a license.         Discussion         10.     The Tribe argues that PacifiCorp is not taking action to obtain water quality         certification and thus is not diligently pursuing its license application.8 The Tribe         therefore asks the Commission to dismiss the relicense application and require the         company to file a plan to decommission the project.9         11.     We agree with the Tribe that the circumstances of this case are far from ideal.         As noted above, Commission staff issued the EIS in November 2007. The Commission         could act on PacifiCorp’s application but for the absence of water quality certification.10         The Klamath Project is operating under the terms of the 1954 license, and, as a result, the         many environmental benefits that could accrue under the new license have not         occurred.11 Under the express terms of the Clean Water Act, however, the Commission                 7                   See, e.g., letter from Mark A. Sturtevant (PacifiCorp) to Kimberly D. Bose         (Commission Secretary), enclosing December 2, 2013 letter from PacifiCorp to Oregon         Department of Water Quality (filed December 16, 2013).                 8                   Petition at 1-12.                 9                   Id. at 12-13.                 10                    There is also a need to conclude consultation under the National Historic         Preservation Act, but such matters, as a rule, do not delay license issuance.                 11                    While we cannot and do not consider the license application now, we note, as         a general matter, that all licenses we have issued in recent times contain substantially         more environmental measures than those issued 50 years ago, before any of the current         environmental statutes were enacted and before the Federal Power Act was amended to         enhance consideration of environmental matters. 20140619-3012 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2014         Project No. 2082-058                                                               -4-         cannot issue and implement a new license until water quality certification has been         issued.         12.     We also agree with the Tribe that PacifiCorp has been complicit with the parties to         the Settlement Agreement in agreeing to delay water quality certification, and that there         is no apparent prospect of the federal legislation called for by the settlement being passed         or of the necessary actions by the Secretary of the Interior taking place. Again, as the         Tribe asserts, infinite delays in licensing proceedings are not in the public interest.         Indeed, they are contrary to it.         13.     Nonetheless, the remedy suggested by the Tribe – requiring PacifiCorp to file a         decommissioning plan – would not resolve the impasse here. Any major         decommissioning would likely result in some form of discharge into the navigable         waters, meaning that the Commission could not implement decommissioning without a         water quality certification.12 Given that we would be acting contrary to the process         envisioned by all the parties to the settlement, including the two water quality certifying         agencies, it appears unlikely that the agencies would issue certification for a         decommissioning process that did not comport with the terms of the settlement to which         they have agreed.13 It seems more probable that they would either deny certification,         thereby precluding decommissioning, or work with PacifiCorp and the other parties to         repeatedly delay certification, as has already occurred in this case.         14.     In addition, while we do have the authority to order a licensee to decommission         a project,14 we have done so only once in the absence of the licensee’s consent, upon a         finding that the facts of the case required that outcome.15 Here, we have not concluded         based on the record that decommissioning is required, and thus lack a basis for imposing                 12                    See, e.g., Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, 120 FERC ¶ 61,054 (2007) at PP 33-36         (stating that Commission could not accept license surrender, which included dam         removal, without state water quality certification), reh’g denied, 123 FERC ¶ 61,069 at         17-21) (2008), aff’d, Jackson County v. FERC, 589 F.3d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 2009).                 13                    Another likely outcome might be for PacifiCorp to file the Settlement         Agreement as its decommissioning plan, even though the plan could not be implemented         absent Congressional and executive department action.                 14                    See Edwards Manufacturing Company, Inc. and City of Augusta, Maine,         81 FERC ¶ 61,255 at 62,207-09 (1997).                 15                    Id. 20140619-3012 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2014         Project No. 2082-058                                                               -5-         such a requirement.16 We are also unsure how demanding that PacifiCorp file a         decommissioning plan when it had already taken substantial steps in that direction in         concert with a large number of parties would yield a positive result. If we had a viable         way to require the parties to move forward, we would certainly consider it. We do not         see such an option before us.         15.     The Tribe asks that, if we do not dismiss PacifiCorp’s license application for lack         of diligence and require a decommissioning plan, we issue a license, based on the         conclusion that California and Oregon have waived water quality certification by failing         to act by the deadline established by the Clean Water Act – a reasonable period of time,         not to exceed one year from the filing of a request for certification.17 The Tribe contends         that the states’ failure to act within one year and their agreement with PacifiCorp not to         do so amount to waiver.18         16.     Again, we have some sympathy with the Tribe’s argument. Indefinite delays in         licensing proceedings do not comport with at least the spirit of the Clean Water Act and         have the effect of preventing us from issuing new licenses that are best adapted to a         current comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway in the public         interest.19 We have previously stated that we “cannot endorse procedures that result in         undue extensions of the licensing process. . . . [Such an] inordinate delay was hardly         what Congress contemplated in crafting the one-year certification deadline.”20         17.     In this case, however, we see little to be gained from finding that the states have         waived certification and then issuing a license. It is clear that PacifiCorp and the other         settling parties are committed to the process envisioned in the Settlement Agreement.         PacifiCorp states in its opposition to the petition that it is endeavoring to implement the         terms of the Settlement Agreement, and will pursue relicensing if the agreement         terminates. Given that we cannot require a licensee to accept a license, and that                 16                    Without in any way prejudging the merits of the relicensing proceeding, we note         that the EIS prepared by our staff recommended decommissioning only some of the         project dams, consist with PacifiCorp’s licensing proposal. We would at a minimum         seriously consider staff’s recommendation in acting in this case.                 17                    See 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a) (2012).                 18                    Petition at 14-21.                 19                    See 16 U.S.C. § 808(a) (2012).                 20                    Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, 113 FERC ¶ 61,167, at P 16, n.14         (2005). 20140619-3012 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/19/2014         Project No. 2082-058                                                              -6-         PacifiCorp views itself as bound to follow the settlement, we see little point in pursuing a         course that would almost certainly leads to protracted litigation and would be unlikely to         resolve the issues in this proceeding.

The Hoopa Valley Tribe (Tribe) has requested rehearing of the Commission’s         June 19, 2014, order1 denying the Tribe’s petition for a declaratory order either         (1) finding that PacifiCorp, the licensee for the Klamath Hydroelectric Project No. 2082,         has failed to diligently pursue relicensing of the project, dismissing PacifiCorp’s relicense         application, and directing PacifiCorp to file a plan for decommissioning the project, or         (2) in the alternative, declaring that the State of California Water Resources Control         Board (California Water Board) and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality         (Oregon DEQ) have waived their authority to issue water quality certification for the         project pursuant to the Clean Water Act. As discussed below, we deny rehearing.         Background         2.      The 169-megawatt Klamath Project is located principally on the Klamath River         in Klamath County, Oregon and Siskiyou County, California.2 The project includes         seven hydroelectric developments and one non-generating dam.3 The Commission’s         predecessor, the Federal Power Commission, issued a 50-year original license for the         project in 1954. The license expired in 2006 and the project has been operated under         annual license since that time.4                 1                   PacifiCorp, 147 FERC ¶ 61,216 (2014) (June 19 Order).                 2                   One development is located on Fall Creek, a tributary to the Klamath.                 3                   See Final Environmental Impact Statement for Hydropower License, Klamath         Hydroelectric Project, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Energy         Projects (November 2007) at xxxiii.                 4                   See 16 U.S.C. § 808(a)(1) (2012). 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                                -2-         3.     On February 25, 2004, PacifiCorp filed with the Commission an application for         a new license for the Klamath Project. The company proposed to relicense five of the         project’s generating developments and to decommission the other three developments,         including the non-generating development. In November 2007, Commission staff issued         a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in the relicensing proceeding.5 Staff         recommended adopting PacifiCorp’s proposal, with the addition of a number of         environmental measures.         4.     On March 5, 2010, PacifiCorp filed with the Commission the Klamath         Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (Settlement Agreement). The Settlement         Agreement, which was signed by the Governors of the States of California and Oregon,         PacifiCorp, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce’s National         Marine Fisheries Service, several Indian tribes (not including the Hoopa Tribe), and a         number of local counties, irrigators, and conservation and fishing groups, provided for         the future removal of PacifiCorp’s licensed Klamath River dams, with a target date of         2020. The parties did not ask the Commission to act on the agreement, the completion of         which is contingent on the passage of federal legislation and action by the Secretary of         the Interior.         5.     To date, no federal legislation regarding the Settlement Agreement has been         enacted,6 and the parties have not requested Commission action.         6.     Under section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act,7 the Commission may not issue a         license authorizing the construction or operation of a hydroelectric project unless the state         water quality certifying agency has either issued a Water Quality Certification for the         project or has waived certification by failing to act on a request for certification within a         reasonable period of time, not to exceed one year.         7.     PacifiCorp filed a request for water quality certification with the California Water         Board on March 29, 2006. Since then, the company has withdrawn and refiled its         application eight times. Similarly, PacifiCorp filed a request for certification with                5                  See n.2, infra.                6                  On May 21, 2014, Senator Wyden introduced S. 2379, entitled, “A bill to         approve and implement the Klamath Basin agreements, to improve natural resource         management, support economic development, and sustain agricultural production in the         Klamath River Basin in the public interest and the interest of the United States, and for         other purposes.”                7                  33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1) (2012). 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                               -3-         Oregon DEQ on March 29, 2006, and has withdrawn and refiled its application eight         times.         8.      On May 25, 2012, the Tribe filed a petition for a declaratory order, asking the         Commission to find that PacifiCorp has failed to diligently pursue relicensing of the         project and accordingly require the company to file a plan for decommissioning the         project, or, in the alternative, find that California and Oregon have waived water quality         certification and issue a new license for the project.         9.      In the June 19 order, the Commission denied the Tribe’s petition. We explained         that, while the circumstances of the Klamath project relicensing are far from ideal, the         Commission is barred by the Clean Water Act from issuing a new license in the absence         of water quality certification from Oregon and California. We further concluded that         ordering PacifiCorp to file a decommissioning plan would be unlikely to resolve the         current impasse, given that the great majority of parties to the relicensing are pursuing         implementation of the settlement, and that decommissioning would probably require         water quality certification, which the states, as supporters of the settlement process,         would not likely issue.8 With respect to the Tribe’s assertion that we should find that         California and Oregon have waived water quality certification, we found that there was         little point in pursuing a course that would almost certainly lead to protracted litigation         and would be unlikely to resolve the issues in this proceeding.9         10.     On July 18, 2014, the Tribe filed a timely request for rehearing.         Discussion                 A. Dismissal of the Relicensing Application         11.     The Tribe reiterates its assertions that PacifiCorp is diligently pursuing neither the         issuance of a new license nor water quality certification, and that delay in relicensing is         not in the public interest.10 It asserts that our conclusion that a decommissioning plan         would require water quality certification that the states would be unlikely to issue is                 8                   June 19 Order, 147 FERC ¶ 61,216 at P 11.                 9                   Id. P 17.                 10                     Request for rehearing at 12-14. The Tribe notes that the Commission has the         authority to deny a new license to an applicant seeking relicensing. Id. at 14. While this         is true, it does not assist us in resolving this case. Denying a new license where no party,         other than the Tribe, seeks such a result, and, indeed, where our staff in the Final EIS         recommended issuing a new license, would be difficult to justify. 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                               -4-         unsupported by the record and an insufficient basis for denying its petition.11 The Tribe         further argues that, if the Commission were to grant the Tribe’s petition,         decommissioning would be the only appropriate course of action. It contends that the         Commission must not let the settlement process play out, but should either dismiss         PacifiCorp’s application for lack of prosecution or find that the states have waived water         quality certification.12         12.     Given that neither the Federal Power Act nor our regulations impose any         requirements with respect to situations such as that presented here, we have considerable         discretion with respect to administering this proceeding. Indeed, “the formulation of         procedures [is] basically to be left within the discretion of the agencies to which Congress         [has] confided the responsibility for substantive judgments.”13 The Tribe points to         nothing in law, regulation, or precedent that requires us to find that PacifiCorp’s         application should be dismissed.         13.     As we explained in the June 19 order, lengthy delays in licensing proceedings are         contrary to the public interest.14 At the same time, we see little to be gained by taking         steps that would likely result in further delay, litigation, and extensive expenditures of         time and money by the parties and the Commission. While it is unfortunately the case         that there are relicensing proceedings that have been pending for many years awaiting         water quality certification,15 there has been no such instance in which we have dismissed                 11                    Id. at 14-17.                 12                    Id. at 17-20. The Tribe asserts that the fact that we have not taken action on the         Settlement Agreement is contrary to our settlement policy. Id. at 5, n.8 (citing         Settlements in Hydropower Licensing Proceedings under Part I of the Federal Power         Act, 116 FERC ¶ 61,270 (2006)). Nothing in our policy or practice requires us to act on         settlements where, as here, the parties explicitly file an agreement for the Commission’s         information only, and not for Commission action.                 13                    Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 435 U.S.         519, 524-25 (1978).                 14                    June 19 Order, 147 FERC ¶ 61,216 at P 12.                 15                    For example, relicensing of the Hells Canyon Project No. 1971 and the Poe         Project No. 2107 has been pending since 2003, while the Upper North Fork Feather River         relicensing has been awaiting water quality certification since 2002, and the Waterbury         Project No. 2090 has been pending since 1999. Of 43 pending license applications         regarding which our staff has completed its environmental analysis, 29 (67 percent) are         awaiting water quality certification. 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                                -5-         a relicense application for the licensee’s failure to diligently pursue the application, in         large part because of the confusion such an action would cause and because we have not         seen a clear path to resolving the issues in these cases.16         14.     We disagree with the Tribe’s assertion that we lacked a basis in the record for         suggesting that California and Oregon would be no more likely to issue water quality         certification for a project decommissioning proceeding than they have been during the         relicensing proceeding.17 In the June 19 Order, we explained that “[g]iven that we would         be acting contrary to the process envisioned by all the parties to the settlement, including         the two water quality certifying agencies, it appears unlikely that the agencies would         issue certification for a decommissioning process that did not comport with the terms of         the settlement to which they have agreed.”18 There is indeed no direct evidence in the         record as to how the agencies would react were we to grant the Tribe’s petition,19 but our         experience, both in this proceeding and generally, led us to conclude that California and         Oregon could not be expected to act more promptly to authorize an outcome they do not         support20 than they have in the relicensing proceeding. We continue to find this         conclusion reasonable.         15.     The Tribe is also incorrect in asserting that requiring a decommissioning plan         would be the only alternative in the case of a dismissed application. We could, for         example, consider the project to be orphaned and seek other applications,21 or we could         issue PacifiCorp a non-power license for all or part of the project.22                 16                    We continue to consider whether there are actions or incentives we can take that         may be appropriate in individual proceedings to break these logjams.                 17                    Request for Rehearing at 16.                 18                    June 19 Order, 147 FERC ¶ 61,216 at P 13.                 19                    It is difficult to envision what evidence there could be, absent a statement by the         agencies as to what they would do in a hypothetical situation.                 20                    As noted in the June 19 order, a number of parties, including PacifiCorp,         Oregon DEQ, and the California Water Board, opposed the Tribe’s petition.                 21                    See 18 C.F.R. § 61.25 (2014). While this section explicitly deals with instances         in which a license fails to file a timely, complete application, we believe that it would be         applicable in the case of an application that we elected to dismiss later in a proceeding.                 22                    See 16 U.S.C. § 808(f) (2012). 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                                  -6-         16.     In sum, the Tribe has shown no error in our decision to deny its request that we         dismiss PacifiCorp’s application and we deny rehearing on this matter.                 B. Waiver of Water Quality Certification         17.     The Tribe argues that we erred in not determining that California and Oregon have         waived water quality certification. The Tribe notes that section 401(a)(1) of the Clean         Water Act provides that if a state “fails or refuses to act on a request for certification,         within a reasonable time (which shall not exceed one year) after receipt of such request,         the certification . . . shall be waived . . . ,”23 and states that the question whether waiver         has occurred is a federal question to be decided by the Commission.24 The Tribe cites a         number of cases, as well as legislative history, for the proposition that Congress intended         the one-year deadline to avoid undue state delay of the federal proceedings.25         18.     We agree with the Tribe that continued delays in completing the water quality         certification are inconsistent with Congress’ intent. We further agree that, in licensing         proceedings before it, the Commission has the obligation to determine whether a state has         complied with the procedures required by the Clean Water Act, including whether a state         has waived certification.26         19.     We part company with the Tribe on whether certification has been waived in this         case. The Tribe carefully hedges its argument, maintaining that it “does not ask the         Commission to declare that the practice of ‘withdrawal and resubmission’ is unlawful in         every instance,”27 but is so only under the facts of this case, including the states’ not         acting within one year of the initial certification requests, the passage of time since the         original requests, the delay in the relicensing proceeding, the states’ agreement with the                 23                    See 33 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1) (2012).                 24                    Request for Rehearing at 20-21.                 25                    Id. at 22-23.                 26                    See, e.g., Alcoa Power Generating Inc. v. FERC, 643 F.3d 963 (D.C. Cir. 2011)         (affirming, as a federal question, the Commission’s determination that a state had not         waived certification); City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (stating that         the Commission was obligated to inquire as to whether a state satisfied the Clean Water         Act’s notice requirements); Keating v. FERC, 927 F.2d 616 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (holding         that the Commission was obligated to determine the effectiveness of a state’s purported         revocation of certification).                 27                    Request for Rehearing at 25. 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                              -7-         licensee not to move forward on certification, and the fact the licensee continues to         operate its project under the terms of its existing license.28         20.     We continue to be concerned that states and licensees that engage in repeated         withdrawal and refiling of applications for water quality certification are acting, in many         cases, contrary to the public interest by delaying the issuance of new licenses that better         meet current-day conditions than those issued many decades ago, and that these entities         are clearly violating the spirit of the Clean Water Act by failing to provide reasonably         expeditious state decisions; however, notwithstanding that concern, we do not conclude         that they have violated the letter of that statute. Section 401(a)(1) provides that a state         waives certification when it does not act on an application within one year. The Act         therefore speaks solely to state action or inaction, rather than the repeated withdrawal         and refiling of applications. By withdrawing its applications before a year has passed,         and presenting the states with new applications, PacifiCorp has, albeit repeatedly, given         the states new deadlines. The record does not reveal that either state has in any instance         failed to act on an application that has been before it for more than one year. Again,         while the Commission continues to be concerned that these entities are violating the spirit         of the Clean Water Act, the particular circumstances here, including the length of the         delay, do not demand a different result because the Act speaks directly only to state         action within one year of a certification request. Accordingly, we find that California and         Oregon have not waived water quality certification in this case.         21.     The Tribe’s reliance on Central Vermont Public Service Corporation29 is         unavailing. In that case, although the state and the licensee had agreed that the licensee         would withdraw and refile its water quality certification application on an annual basis,         the licensee ultimately failed to do so and the state did not act on the then-pending         application before the one-year deadline. We held that the passage of the deadline         resulted in waiver, regardless of the fact that the two parties had intended to continue the         withdrawal and refiling process: the governing fact was the expiration of the one-year         period.30 Here, whether for good or ill, PacifiCorp has withdrawn and refiled its         certification applications numerous times. The Tribe does not assert that the states         missed the one-year deadline with respect to any single one of the company’s         applications. In essence, PacifiCorp and the states have avoided the error that Vermont         and the licensee in that proceeding made. Accordingly, Central Vermont is inapposite         here.                 28                    Id. at 25-26.                 29                    113 FERC ¶ 61,167 (2005) (Central Vermont). See Request for Rehearing at         23-24.                 30                    See Central Vermont 113 FERC ¶ 61,167 at PP 15-16. 20141016-3014 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 10/16/2014         Project No. 2082-061                                                               -8-         22.     The Tribe goes on to argue that our decision not to declare that California and         Oregon have waived water quality certification is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of         discretion. The Tribe again asserts that our conclusions that the parties to the settlement         are committed to it is unsupported by the record and that the public interest requires us to         issue a new license or a decommissioning order.31         23.     As we have explained, it is the Clean Water Act that prescribes when a state         agency has waived certification; it is not an exercise of discretion vested in the         Commission. If our interpretation of the statute is incorrect, that would be for the courts         to determine.32 As to the adherence of the settling parties to their agreement, we have no         way of knowing how firm their commitment is, but we think it a reasonable assumption         that entities will support an agreement which they have voluntarily negotiated and signed.                 31                    Request for Rehearing at 26-30. The Tribe also objects to what it asserts is the         Commission’s “failure to reinitiate the licensing process [because] it cannot require a         licensee to accept a license.” Id. at 29. In the June 19 Order, 147 FERC ¶ 61,216 at P 17,         we simply intended to indicate that the likely negative reaction to our issuing a license         that ignored the wishes of the settling parties gave us little incentive to pursue untested         legal theories. We nonetheless fully agree with the Tribe that we must issue licenses that         satisfy the public interest standards established by the Federal Power Act, and we do not         base licensing decisions on whether the applicant (or any other entity) will be pleased by         our actions. We further agree, as noted above, that a new license would bring the project         in line with current environmental standards. Were we to determine that water quality         certification has been waived here, we would then issue a license that we concluded met         the public interest, as we have done in other cases involving waiver.

On November 26, 2013, Idaho Power Company and IDACORP Energy Services         Company (collectively, IDACORP) and Powerex Corp. (Powerex) (collectively, the         Settling Parties) filed a Settlement Agreement in the above-referenced proceeding. On         December 6, 2013, Commission Trial Staff filed comments in support of the Settlement 20140221-3046 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/21/2014         Docket No. EL01-10-129                                                                                                     2         Agreement. On December 20, 2013, the Settlement Judge certified the uncontested         Settlement Agreement to the Commission.1         2.      The Settlement Agreement addresses claims arising from events and transactions         in the Pacific Northwest and the remainder of the Western Markets as they may relate to         transactions between the Settling Parties. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the         standard of review as between the Settling Parties will be the “public interest” application         of the just and reasonable standard as set forth in Mobile-Sierra. For modifications to the         Settlement proposed by the Commission acting sua sponte or by a non-settling party, the         most stringent standard permissible under applicable law will apply. Because the         Settlement Agreement appears to invoke the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” presumption         or, alternatively, the most stringent standard permissible under applicable law with         respect to the Commission acting sua sponte and third parties, we will analyze the         applicability here of that more rigorous application of the just and reasonable standard.         3.      The Mobile-Sierra “public interest” presumption applies to an agreement only if         the agreement has certain characteristics that justify the presumption. In ruling on         whether the characteristics necessary to justify a Mobile-Sierra presumption are present,         the Commission must determine whether the agreement at issue embodies either:         (1) individualized rates, terms, or conditions that apply only to sophisticated parties who         negotiated them freely at arm’s length; or (2) rates, terms, or conditions that are generally         applicable or that arose in circumstances that do not provide the assurance of justness and         reasonableness associated with arm’s-length negotiations. Unlike the latter, the former         constitute contract rates, terms, or conditions that necessarily qualify for a Mobile-Sierra         presumption. In New England Power Generators Association v. FERC,2 however, the         D.C. Circuit determined that the Commission is legally authorized to impose a more         rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review on future         changes to agreements that fall within the second category described above.         4.      The Commission finds that the Settlement Agreement involves contract rates to         which the Mobile-Sierra presumption applies. The Settlement Agreement addresses         litigation between the Settling Parties that included: (i) whether there were amounts paid         for energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest spot market during the time from         December 25, 2000 to and including June 21, 2001, including energy purchased in the         Pacific Northwest that ultimately was consumed in California, that the Commission                 1                   Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity,         145 FERC ¶ 63,018 (2013).                 2                   New England Power Generators Ass’n, Inc. v. FERC, 707 F.3d 364, 370-371         (D.C. Cir. 2013). 20140221-3046 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/21/2014         Docket No. EL01-10-129                                                                                                       3         might find to have been unjust and unreasonable; (ii) if so, whether any remedy should be         awarded; (iii) whether evidence of market manipulation, submitted after the         Administrative Law Judge made factual findings would affect the Commission’s award         or denial of refunds in the proceeding. The Settlement Agreement applies to transactions         between IDACORP and Powerex only. These circumstances distinguish the Settlement         Agreement in this case from the settlements in other cases, such as High Island Offshore         System, LLC,3 which the Commission held did not involve contract rates to which the         Mobile-Sierra presumption applied. The settlements in those cases involved the         pipelines’ generally applicable rate schedules for its open access transportation services.         5.      The Settlement Agreement consists primarily of mutual releases and waivers         between IDACORP and Powerex and resolves all claims between them, including ripple         claims.4 However, we find that certain provisions of the Settlement Agreement do not         accord with the Commission’s express policy regarding the preservation of potential         ripple claims by third-parties, and we therefore reject them.         6.      On June 13, 2012, the Commission conditionally approved a settlement between         IDACORP and the City of Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma) (March 12, 2012 Settlement)         that resolved claims between them associated with their market activities in the Pacific         Northwest for the January 1, 2000 through June 20, 2001 settlement period. In that order,         the Commission required the removal of reciprocal waiver provisions that Powerex and         the PPL Companies5 challenged as affecting their rights to bring ripple claims.         Following the Commission’s denial of IDACORP’s request for rehearing of the June 13,         2012 Order, IDACORP petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review of the Commission         orders.6                 3                   135 FERC ¶ 61,105 (2011); see also Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., LP,         143 FERC ¶ 61,041 (2013); Southern LNG Co., LLC, 135 FERC ¶ 61,153 (2011);         Carolina Gas Transmission Corp., 136 FERC ¶ 61,014 (2011).                 4                   In 2001, the ALJ in the underlying docket defined “ripple claims” as “sequential         claims against a succession of sellers in a chain of purchases that are triggered if the last         wholesale purchaser in the chain is entitled to a refund.” Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All         Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy, 96 FERC ¶ 63,044, at 65,300 (2001) (Cintron, J.).                 5                   The relevant PPL Companies are PPL Montana, LLC and PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.                 6                   See Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v.

June 24, 2013) (Case No. 13-72220). The         appeal was held in abeyance at the request of IDACORP, as this proposed settlement had         the potential to resolve the appeal. 20140221-3046 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/21/2014         Docket No. EL01-10-129                                                                                                         4         7.      Article III, section 8 of the Settlement Agreement provides that within five days of         Commission approval of the Settlement Agreement, the Commission will seek leave from         the Ninth Circuit for the Commission to issue further orders so as to modify its earlier         orders to approve the March 12, 2012 Settlement as it was originally filed, subject to the         addition of a new article that would preserve the PPL Companies’ ability to pursue ripple         claims. Thus, PPL Companies could still pursue ripple claims, but all other non-parties         would be foreclosed from pursuing them.7 Article III, section 9 of the Settlement         Agreement states that IDACORP will withdraw its petition for review in the Ninth         Circuit within five days of the occurrence of the above conditions.         8.      Together, these two provisions contravene the Commission’s policy regarding the         preservation of potential ripple claims by third parties. In its order on the March 12, 2012         Settlement, the Commission approved the settlement on the condition that those portions         of the settlement that purport to preclude potential ripple claims of non-parties be         removed.8 In its rehearing and compliance filing, IDACORP requested rehearing of the         Commission’s position on ripple claims, and on compliance, provided two alternative         settlement versions for the Commission’s consideration. Alternative (1) modified the         settlement so as to preserve rights of Powerex and PPL Companies alone to litigate their         potential ripple claims. Alternative (2) modified the settlement so that it preserved the         right of any non-settling party to pursue potential ripple claims. The Commission         accepted Alternative (2) stating that it “intended that no non-settling third party, not just         Powerex and PPL Companies, should have any potential rights extinguished by the         Settlement.”9 IDACORP then filed its petition for review.         9.      In light of the foregoing, the Commission rejects Article III, section 8 in its         entirety, as well as the portion of Article III, section 9 that refers to the occurrence of the         conditions described in Article III, section 8 of the Settlement Agreement, as they are         contrary to the Commission’s explicit policy regarding ripple claims and constitute an         impermissible collateral attack on the Commission’s prior orders. In accordance with our         prior holdings, we reaffirm that the proposed Settlement Agreement cannot be used to         extinguish potential claims of others.10 Removal of these provisions is consistent with                 7                   Note that the parties to the Settlement Agreement (IDACORP and Powerex) seek         to amend the March 12, 2012 Settlement between IDACORP and Tacoma. Tacoma filed         no comments with respect to the instant Settlement Agreement.                 8                   Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 139 FERC ¶ 61,209 at PP 6-7.                 9                   Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 141 FERC ¶ 61,148 at P 16.                 10                    See Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 139 FERC ¶ 61,209 at P 7; Puget Sound Energy,         Inc., 141 FERC ¶ 61,148 at P 10. 20140221-3046 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/21/2014         Docket No. EL01-10-129                                                                                                     5         the history of this proceeding, which preserved potential ripple claims.11 It is also         consistent with the Commission’s policy to favor settlement agreements that do not         impair the rights of non-parties.12 The remainder of the Settlement Agreement appears to         be just and reasonable and in the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission approves         the Settlement Agreement on the condition that it is modified so as to remove the rejected         provisions as set forth herein. IDACORP and Powerex are directed to submit a         compliance filing within thirty days of the issuance of this order consistent with the body         of this order.

On March 24, 2014, Idaho Power Company and IDACORP Energy Services         Company (collectively, IDACORP) filed a request for rehearing (Rehearing Request) of a         February 21, 2014 Commission letter order1 that conditionally approved a settlement         agreement (Settlement) between IDACORP and Powerex Corp.

All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy, 146 FERC         ¶ 61,123 (2014) (Settlement Order). 20140617-3050 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/17/2014         Docket Nos. EL01-10-132 and EL01-10-133                                           -2-         comments in support of the Settlement on December 6, 2013. The Settlement Judge         certified the Settlement to the Commission as uncontested on December 20, 2013.2         3.      The Settlement consisted primarily of mutual releases and waivers between         IDACORP and Powerex and resolved all claims between them, including “ripple         claims.”3 However, in the Settlement Order, the Commission found that certain         provisions of the Settlement did not accord with the Commission’s policy regarding the         preservation of potential ripple claims by third-parties, and therefore accepted the         Settlement subject to the removal of those provisions in a compliance filing.4                 A.      The Commission’s Prior Orders on Ripple Claims         4.      In support of its decision, the Commission referred to its June 13, 2012 order in         which it conditionally approved a similar settlement between IDACORP and the City         of Tacoma, Washington (Tacoma) (March 12, 2012 Settlement) that resolved claims         between them arising out of the same proceeding. In that order, the Commission also         required the removal of reciprocal waiver provisions that Powerex and the PPL         Companies5 challenged as affecting their rights to bring ripple claims. Following the         Commission’s denial of IDACORP’s request for rehearing of the June 13, 2012         Settlement Order, IDACORP petitioned the Ninth Circuit for review of the Commission         orders.6         5.      In the June 13, 2012 Settlement Order, the Commission approved the settlement         on the condition that those portions of the settlement that preclude potential ripple claims         of non-parties be removed.7 IDACORP requested rehearing of the Commission’s                 2                   Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity,         145 FERC ¶ 63,018 (2013).                 3                   In 2001, the ALJ in the underlying docket defined “ripple claims” as “sequential         claims against a succession of sellers in a chain of purchases that are triggered if the last         wholesale purchaser in the chain is entitled to a refund.” Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All         Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy, 96 FERC ¶ 63,044, at 65,300 (2001) (Cintron, J.).                 4                   Settlement Order, 145 FERC ¶ 63,018 at PP 5-9.                 5                   The relevant PPL Companies are PPL Montana, LLC and PPL EnergyPlus, LLC.                 6                   See Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v.

FERC, No. 13-72220 (9th Cir. June 24,         2013) (Case No. 13-72220).                 7                   June 13, 2012 Settlement Order, 139 FERC ¶ 61,209 at PP 6-7. 20140617-3050 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/17/2014         Docket Nos. EL01-10-132 and EL01-10-133                                               -3-         position on ripple claims, and on compliance, provided two alternative settlement         versions for the Commission’s consideration. Alternative (1) modified the settlement so         as to preserve rights of Powerex and PPL Companies alone to litigate their potential         ripple claims. Alternative (2) modified the settlement so that it preserved the right of any         non-settling party to pursue potential ripple claims. The Commission accepted         Alternative (2) stating that it “intended that no non-settling third party, not just Powerex         and PPL Companies, should have any potential rights extinguished by the Settlement.”8         IDACORP then filed its petition for review in that case.                 B.      The Current Settlement’s Improper Provisions         6.      In this matter, Article III, section 8 of the Settlement provided that within five         days of Commission approval of the Settlement, the Commission would seek leave from         the Ninth Circuit for the Commission to issue further orders to modify its earlier orders to         approve the March 12, 2012 Settlement between IDACORP and Tacoma as it was         originally filed. This modification would reinstate the reciprocal waiver provisions that         the Commission had required to be removed from the March 12, 2012 Settlement. Also,         section 8 of the Settlement would add a new article to this Settlement that would preserve         the PPL Companies’ ability to pursue ripple claims. Thus, PPL Companies could still         pursue ripple claims, but all other non-parties would be foreclosed from pursuing them.9         Article III, section 9 of the Settlement stated that IDACORP would withdraw its petition         for review in the Ninth Circuit within five days of the occurrence of the above conditions.         The Commission found that together, these two provisions contravened the         Commission’s policy regarding the preservation of potential ripple claims by third         parties.10         7.      Therefore, consistent with its earlier rulings, the Commission rejected Article III,         section 8 in its entirety, as well as the portion of Article III, section 9 that referred to the         occurrence of the conditions described in Article III, section 8 of the Settlement. The         Commission found the provisions were contrary to the Commission’s policy regarding         ripple claims and constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the Commission’s                 8                   Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 141 FERC ¶ 61,148 at P 16.                 9                   We note that IDACORP and Powerex, the parties to this Settlement, sought to         amend the March 12, 2012 Settlement between IDACORP and a different party, i.e.,         Tacoma. Tacoma filed no comments with respect to the instant Settlement.                 10                    See, e.g., San Diego Gas & Elec. Co. v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary Serv.,         113 FERC ¶ 61,171, at P 40 (2005), reh’g denied, 115 FERC ¶ 61,032, at P 23 (2006)         (Commission policy favors settlement agreements that do not impair the rights of non-         parties). 20140617-3050 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/17/2014         Docket Nos. EL01-10-132 and EL01-10-133                                            -4-         prior orders.11 The Commission then reaffirmed that the proposed Settlement could not         be used to extinguish potential claims of others.12 The Commission emphasized that         removal of these provisions was consistent with the history of this proceeding, which         preserved potential ripple claims.13 The Commission also found that removal of those         provisions was consistent with the Commission’s policy to favor settlement agreements         that do not impair the rights of non-parties.14         8.      The Settlement Order then found that the remainder of the Settlement appeared to         be just and reasonable and in the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission approved         the Settlement on the condition that the rejected provisions be removed and directed         IDACORP and Powerex to submit a compliance filing within thirty days of the issuance         of the Settlement Order.         II.     IDACORP’s Rehearing Request         9.      In its Rehearing Request, IDACORP argues that the Commission should not         reject portions of the Settlement based on the Commission’s statement that it disfavors         settlements that impair the rights of non-parties. IDACORP contends this preference         should not be applied as if it were a rule. Further, IDACORP contends that the         Commission also failed to identify any segment of the public that would be adversely         affected by the Settlement and what public interest was served by its partial rejection of         the Settlement.15         10.     IDACORP next argues that ripple claims are irrelevant and illusory. IDACORP         states the Settlement Order’s inclusion of the definition of ripple claims from Judge                 11                    Settlement Order, 146 FERC ¶ 61,123 at P 9.                 12                    See Puget Sound Energy, Inc., 139 FERC ¶ 61,209 at P 7; Puget Sound Energy,         Inc., 141 FERC ¶ 61,148 at P 10.                 13                    See, e.g., Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or         Capacity, 103 FERC ¶ 61,348, at PP 47-50 (2003) (stating that the “ALJ determined that         all parties reserved their rights to pursue claims if the Commission was to direct further         proceedings to determine refunds”). See also Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v. All         Jurisdictional Sellers of Energy and/or Capacity, Docket No. EL01-10-026, at P 10         (Nov. 23, 2011) (Order of the Chief Judge Confirming Settlement Procedures) (“This         Order shall not be construed to either diminish or enlarge the right of any Party to assert         its position with respect to Ripple Claims.”).                 14                    See footnote 10, supra.                 15                    Rehearing Request at 2, 5-6, 8-9. 20140617-3050 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/17/2014         Docket Nos. EL01-10-132 and EL01-10-133                                              -5-         Carmen A. Cintron’s 2001 Recommendations and Proposed Findings of Fact (see         footnote 3, supra) reflects the status of the case at the time, but it does not fit within the         case the Commission described in its Order on Remand.16 IDACORP argues that this         case is now confined to seller-specific and contract-specific claims and remedies, not         market-wide claims and remedies.17         11.     Finally, IDACORP argues the Settlement Order could be read to direct IDACORP         to withdraw its petition for review in the Ninth Circuit.18 IDACORP states that if this         provision was intended to require IDACORP to withdraw its petition for review, it is         contrary to the statutory right of review created by the Federal Power Act (FPA) and         would exceed the Commission’s authority.19         III.    Commission Determination         12.     IDACORP contends that the Commission’s policy of disfavoring settlements that         impair the rights of non-parties “does not exist and cannot be applied as if was a rule[,]”20         pointing to cases in which the Commission has approved settlements as to non-settling         parties that did not challenge the settlements.21 However, the Commission possesses         authority to approve settlements involving non-settling parties only if the Commission is         able to make the necessary findings, including that the settlement is in the public         interest.22 Accordingly, it is well-settled that the Commission has an independent                 16                    Puget Sound Energy, Inc. v.

Cir. 2007) ( “the         Commission may adopt an uncontested settlement only after finding it ‘fair and         reasonable and in the public interest;’ that is, the Commission has a duty to disapprove         uncontested settlements that are unfair, unreasonable, or against the public interest.’”);         Mobil Oil Corp. v.

Petal Gas, for example, affirmed the Commission’s rejection of an uncontested         settlement between a pipeline and certain shippers, “the active parties to the settlement,”         based upon “the interests of its inactive parties,” finding this to represent the         “independent consideration of fairness and reasonableness and the public interest the         Commission is duty-bound to give.”24 Similarly, courts have affirmed Commission         orders lowering the rate agreed to in an uncontested settlement, based upon its impact on         third parties.25         14.      Here, the Commission found that preserving the potential for future ripple claims         was “consistent with the Commission’s policy to favor settlement agreements that do not         impair the rights of non-parties.”26 The Commission determined that the settlement         language foreclosing ripple claims was not fair and reasonable and in the public interest.         On that basis, the Commission determined not to approve the uncontested settlement with         language that would “extinguish potential claims of others.”27 This determination is well         within the Commission’s discretion, and we deny rehearing on this basis.         have the responsibility to make an independent judgment as to whether the settlement         is ‘fair and reasonable and in the public interest’”); Saltville Gas Storage Co., L.L.C.,         128 FERC ¶ 61,257, at P 9 (2009) (“Indeed, the Commission exercises this authority         when necessary, attaching conditions to uncontested settlements, and even rejecting some         entirely….The Commission exercises this authority particularly when the settlement, as         this one, may have an impact on future parties or others not present during the         negotiations.”); Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co., 127 FERC ¶ 61,217 (2009)         (uncontested settlement approval conditioned upon revision of section that may adversely         affect similarly-situated shippers across the grid).                  23                     See id.                  24                     496 F.3d at 701.                  25                     Penn.

EL01-10-132 and EL01-10-133                                            -7-         15.     IDACORP next argues that the perseveration of ripple claims makes little sense in         light of the Commission’s Order on Remand that foreclosed the availability of a market-         wide remedy. However, in its Settlement Order, the Commission found that foreclosing         ripple claims would be contrary to the history of the Pacific Northwest refund         proceeding, in which the rights of parties to assert ripple claims in the future should         circumstances arise had been preserved.28 Even prior to the remand of the Pacific         Northwest refund proceeding, the Commission held that all parties reserved their rights to         pursue ripple claims in the event of further proceedings to determine refunds.29         16.     The Commission has previously acknowledged that the potential for ripple claims         was, at best, speculative.30 Nevertheless, the Commission weighed the interest in finality         with the possible foreclosure of a non-party’s claim, and determined it could not approve         the uncontested Settlement with language that would foreclose even remotely possible         third party claims.         17.     Also, as we previously noted,31 there has never been any intent to foreclose ripple         claims, to the extent they could arise.32 Accordingly, we reaffirm that the Settlement         between IDACORP and Powerex cannot be used to extinguish potential claims of non-         settling parties. IDACORP also retains its right to argue that there is no basis for a ripple         claim should some party attempt to make such a claim; it simply cannot preclude non-         settling parties from even making such a claim. We therefore deny rehearing on this         basis.         18.     Finally, we clarify that the Settlement Order did not direct IDACORP to withdraw         its petition for review. The Commission merely directed those portions of the Settlement         that would foreclose potential ripple claims be removed from the Settlement in the         Compliance Filing.                 28                    See footnote 13, supra.                 29                    Id.                 30                    June 13, 2012 Settlement Order, 139 FERC ¶ 61,209 at P 7.                 31                    Id.

IDACORP’s March 24, 2014 Compliance Filing removes Article III, sections 8         and 9 in their entirety, corrects a misspelled word, and makes no other changes.33 Notice         of the Compliance Filing was published in the Federal Register, 79 Fed. Reg. 18,292         (2014), with comments due on or before April 14, 2014. No comments were filed.         20.    In its Compliance Filing, IDACORP states that it proposes to remove the entire         section 8, as directed by the Commission, and section 9 to ensure that there is not a         requirement that IDACORP withdraw its petition for review currently pending before the         United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, because the necessary operative         pre-condition would be removed.         21.    We accept IDACORP’s Compliance Filing as in compliance with the Settlement         Order.         The Commission orders:                (A) IDACORP’s request for rehearing of the Settlement Order is denied, and         the Settlement Order is clarified as discussed in the body of this order.                (B) IDACORP’s Compliance Filing is accepted as in compliance with the         Settlement Order         By the Commission.

Docket No. EL15-17-000         Tucson Electric Power Company                                      ORDER DENYING COMPLAINT                                           (Issued February 19, 2015)         1.     In this order, the Commission denies a complaint filed on November 7, 2014 by         Alterna Springerville LLC, LDVF1 TEP LLC, Wilmington Trust Company, and William         J. Wade (collectively, Complainants) against Tucson Electric Power Company (Tucson),         requesting firm transmission service over a specified path to a specific delivery point at         Palo Verde.         I.     Background         2.     Complainants and Tucson jointly own the Springerville Generating Station         (Springerville) Unit 1, a 380 MW coal-fired electric generating facility. Complainants         and Tucson are parties to separate leaseback agreements (Lease Agreements), dated         December 15, 1986, and amended in 1992, under which Tucson leased a 195 MW energy         entitlement in Springerville 1 from Complainants. The Lease Agreements expired on         January 1, 2015.1 Upon expiration of the Lease Agreements, Complainants’ energy         entitlement, representing 50.5 percent (195 MW) of the generation capacity in         Springerville Unit 1, reverted back to Complainants, who are now responsible for         marketing their respective generation output.                1                  Tucson also owns 49.5 percent of Springerville Unit 1, which is designated as a         network resource and used to serve its native load. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                           -2-         3.      Tucson and Complainants are also parties to a Facility Support Agreement,         executed in 1986, as amended and restated in 1992 (1992 FSA), which addresses, among         other things, the parties’ obligations with respect to maintenance and operation of         Springerville Unit 1, cost responsibilities, and post-lease transmission service         requirements. Upon expiration of the Lease Agreements, section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA         states that Tucson must transmit Complainants’ scheduled energy entitlements from         Springerville Unit 1 “on a firm (and not interruptible) and non-discriminatory basis, over         transmission facilities of Tucson from [Springerville] Unit 1 to a point or points of         interconnection specified from time to time by Tucson subject to [Complainants’]         reasonable approval (each, a ‘Point of Interconnection’) with transmission facilities         owned by another utility and subject to jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act, as         amended.”2         4.      In order to transmit their share of the Springerville Unit 1 generation,         Complainants require transmission service from Tucson, over the San Juan-Springerville-         Vail transmission system, a network of transmission facilities running from the San Juan         Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico to the Vail Substation in southeastern         Arizona. Tucson has offered Complainants firm transmission service with a delivery         point of the San Juan Generating Station (San Juan) or the Four Corners Power Plant         (Four Corners); Complainants requested delivery to Palo Verde.         5.      On November 7, 2014, Complainants filed a complaint against Tucson, asserting         that Tucson has denied firm transmission service rights to which Complainants are         entitled under the 1992 FSA, in favor of transmitting Tucson’s own generation and         generation owned by others. Complainants allege that Tucson has: (1) denied         Complainants firm transmission service in violation of certain pre-Open Access         Transmission Tariff (OATT) contractual commitments; (2) failed to reserve transmission         capacity needed to provide that transmission service, as required by Tucson’s OATT;         (3) unduly discriminated against Complainants with regard to transmission access; and         (4) granted undue preference for its own generation with regard to transmission access.         II.     Notice of Filing and Responsive Pleadings         6.      Notice of Complainants’ filing was published in the Federal Register, 79 Fed.         Reg. 68,433 (2014), with interventions and protests due on or before November 28, 2014.         Motions to intervene were filed by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) and         El Paso Electric Company (El Paso). On November 11, 2014, Tucson filed a motion for         extension of time to answer the complaint and request for expedited treatment. On                 2                   Complaint, Ex. 1 (Menaker Aff.), Att. D (1992 Facility Support Agreement), at         § 5.1 (1992 FSA). 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                            -3-         November 15, 2014, Complainants filed an answer to the motion for extension of time.         On November 18, 2014, the Commission issued a notice granting an extension of time         until December 5, 2014. On December 3, 2014, Tucson filed an answer to the complaint         (Tucson Answer). On December 12, 2014, Complainants filed a motion for partial         summary disposition and establishment of limited evidentiary hearing. On December 29,         2014, Tucson filed an answer to Complainants’ December 12, 2014 motion. On         December 30, 2014, SunZia Transmission, LLC (SunZia) filed a motion to intervene out         of time.         III.   Discussion                A.       Procedural Matters         7.     Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,         18 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2014), the timely, unopposed motions to intervene serve to make         PNM and El Paso parties to this proceeding. Pursuant to Rule 214(d) of the         Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. § 385.214(d) (2014), the         Commission will grant the late-filed motion to intervene of SunZia given its interest in         the proceeding, the early stage of the proceeding, and the absence of undue prejudice or         delay. Further, we dismiss Complainants’ motion for summary disposition as moot,         given our resolution of the proceeding in this order.                B.       Substantive Matters         8.     Complainants assert that Tucson has denied firm transmission service rights to         which Complainants are entitled under section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA, in favor of         transmitting Tucson’s own generation and generation owned by others. Specifically         Complainants state that they have requested firm transmission for their energy         entitlement from Springerville Unit 1 to the Palo Verde switchyard, beginning on January         1, 2015. However, Complainants assert that Tucson has indicated that there is no         available transfer capability on the path from Springerville Unit 1 to Palo Verde.         Complainants state that prior to the expiration of the Lease Agreements, Tucson used the         transmission path for its leased interest in the Springerville Unit 1 output, however,         Tucson intends to take that transmission capacity after the Lease Agreements expire and         use the capacity to transmit energy from a recently-acquired generator, the Gila River         Power Station (Gila River), notwithstanding its prior contractual obligations reflected in         the 1992 FSA. Therefore, Complainants request that the Commission require Tucson to         transmit Complainants’ energy entitlement consistent with Tucson’s contractual         obligations and its OATT.3 Complainants also request that the Commission require                3                  Id. at 3-4. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                              -4-         Tucson to provide transmission service to Complainants at discounted rates similar to         rates reflected in recently filed transmission service agreements with Salt River Project         Agricultural Improvement and Power District (Salt River Project).4                        1.      Tucson’s Obligations Under the 1992 FSA                                a.     Complaint         9.      Complainants argue that Tucson has violated pre-OATT contractual commitments         by failing to provide firm transmission service for Complainants’ energy entitlements         from Springerville Unit 1 to the Palo Verde Switchyard. Complainants aver that the sale-         and-leaseback transaction was structured to require Tucson to provide Complainants with         “commercially reasonable” firm transmission rights after the Lease Agreements expired         on January 1, 2015. Specifically, Complainants contend that the sale-and-leaseback         transaction involving Springerville Unit 1 hinged on the transaction comporting with an         Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Ruling in April 1982, in which the IRS         generally addressed the federal income tax consequences of a sale-and-leaseback         transaction of an undivided interest in a coal-fired electric generating facility, and found         that the parties were required to structure the transaction so that each Owner/Lessor         would, following expiration of the lease, be able to market the electrical output of the         facility on a basis that is commercially feasible.5         10.     Complainants state that the sale-and-leaseback of Springerville Unit 1 was         modeled after the transaction described in the 1982 Revenue Ruling and was intended to         enable Complainants to take advantage of the tax savings available as a result of the         relatively short depreciation life of Springerville Unit 1.6 Complainants assert that the         contractual rights available to them at the termination of the Lease Agreements as of         January 1, 2015 were intended to ensure that Complainants would have an asset with a         residual value at lease expiration of at least 20 percent of the original value of their                 4                   On October 17, 2014, as amended on November 21, 2014, Tucson filed in         Docket No. ER15-124-000 four executed, non-conforming long-term firm point-to-point         transmission service agreements (TSAs) with Salt River Project under Tucson’s OATT,         together with three notices of termination. The TSAs in Docket No. ER15-124-000 are         pending.                 5                   Complaint at 8 (citing Rev. Rul. 82-61, 1982-1 C.B. 13, appended as Ex. 1         (Menaker Aff.), Att. B (1982 Revenue Ruling)).                 6                   In June 1986, Tucson secured a ruling from the IRS, which found that the         Springerville Unit 1 was entitled to depreciation for tax purposes over five years rather         than over 15 years. Id. at 7. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                           -5-         ownership share of Springerville Unit 1 that could be sold to someone other than Tucson.         Complainants further assert that other contemporaneous documents, including an         appraisal by R. W. Beck and various memoranda, support Complainants’ argument.         Complainants claim that the investors involved in the transaction relied on the analyses in         these documents when evaluating potential investments in Springerville Unit 1 and that         the sale-and-leaseback transaction documents make clear that the parties’ intent was for         the IRS-required residual value of Springerville Unit 1 to be realized by Complainants         following expiration of the Lease Agreements, because they would be granted         transmission service that would allow them to sell their energy entitlements on a         commercially feasible basis.         11.     Complainants also assert that the subsequent restructuring of the sale-and-         leaseback transaction reaffirmed Tucson’s firm transmission obligations. Complainants         state that, in 1992, the 1986 FSA was amended in a manner that preserved Complainants’         ability to sell their scheduled energy entitlements from Springerville Unit 1 to persons         other than the lessee (i.e., Tucson), on a “commercially feasible basis.” Specifically,         Complainants argue that sections 2.1, 5.1, and 5.4 of the 1992 FSA obligate Tucson, upon         expiration of the Lease Agreements, to transmit electricity from Springerville Unit 1 on         behalf of the entitlement owners on a firm and non-discriminatory basis to a point or         points of interconnection on the Tucson transmission system that meet Complainants’         reasonable approval. The relevant 1992 FSA provisions are:                         Section 2.1. Maintenance of Project Documents;                         Alternate Operating Agreement. Tucson hereby                         covenants and agrees (i) to maintain in full force and                         effect the Project Documents, (ii) to cause the Facility                         to be operated in accordance with the terms of the                         Project Documents, (iii) to perform all of its duties and                         obligations set forth therein and to exercise all of its                         rights thereunder to cause the operator thereunder                         (whether or not Tucson) to perform its duties and                         obligations and (iv) not to take any action, including                         any modification or amendment to or waiver of the                         Project Documents, thereunder or permit any action to                         be taken thereunder which would have any adverse                         effect on [Complainants] or [their] respective                         Undivided Interest . . . .                                              *       *      *                         Section 5.1.

Service Continuity. Tucson shall use                       reasonable diligence in accordance with Prudent                       Utility Practice to prevent and minimize interruption of                       wheeling service supplied hereunder, but does not                       guarantee such service against interruptions due to                       Uncontrollable Forces. In the event sufficient                       transmission capacity is not available, because of                       Uncontrollable Forces, to serve [Complainants’] power                       schedules, such schedules shall be reduced on a pro                       rata basis in accordance with [Complainants’]                       respective Entitlement Shares. No reduction of                       [Complainants’] power schedules due to                       Uncontrollable Forces will discriminate against                       [Complainants] relative to Tucson’s other firm (and                       not interruptible) wheeling customers.         12.    Thus, Complainants assert that the 1992 FSA explicitly protects their rights to         have their scheduled energy entitlements from Springerville Unit 1 delivered on a firm         and nondiscriminatory basis from Springerville Unit 1 to markets that are reasonably         acceptable to Complainants and precludes Tucson from taking actions that would have an         adverse effect on Complainants, such as denying them transmission rights to make room         for other generation, including generation owned by Tucson.         13.    Complainants contend that the only delivery point on Tucson’s system that is         commercially reasonable for sale of energy entitlement from Springerville Unit 1 is Palo         Verde. Complainants note that, although Tucson concedes its obligation to provide firm         transmission service, the delivery points offered by Tucson to Complainants are not         liquid markets because they are thinly traded, and the addition of Complainants’ energy 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                            -7-         entitlement from Springerville Unit 1 (collectively 195 MW) would cause market prices         at those locations to plummet.7 Specifically, Complainants state that Tucson has offered         delivery points to either San Juan or Four Corners, both of which are north of         Springerville Unit 1. Complainants assert that, in order for energy from Springerville         Unit 1 to be transmitted to Palo Verde through either of those delivery points,         Complainants would need to purchase additional transmission from another transmission         provider. Complainants claim that, based on expected energy prices in the region over         the remaining service life of Springerville Unit 1, the additional costs for transmission         service that Complainants would incur would make it impossible for Complainants to         secure reasonable market prices for their energy entitlements from Springerville Unit 1.8         Complainants argue that Palo Verde is the only delivery point which is reasonably         acceptable to Complainants because it is the only delivery point which preserves the         residual value of Complainants’ beneficial interests in Springerville Unit 1, as required         by the sale-and-leaseback transaction. Complainants contend that section 5.1 of the FSA         requires Tucson to provide transmission service to deliver power from Springerville Unit         1 to Palo Verde, and that Tucson has violated section 5.1 by refusing to provide that         service for Complainants.                                 b.     Answer         14.     Tucson states that the complaint lacks merit and should be dismissed because         Tucson has complied with the 1992 FSA that forms the basis of the complaint. Tucson         states that it has not violated the terms of the 1992 FSA by failing to provide         Complainants firm transmission service, or by granting Salt River Project transmission         service, or by reserving firm transmission for its own load-serving needs. Tucson alleges         that the complaint twists the language of the 1992 FSA in an effort to impose an         obligation on Tucson, and to claim rights for Complainants, which do not exist.         15.     Tucson argues that section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA requires Tucson to transmit the         energy entitlements from Springerville Unit 1 to one or more points of interconnection         that are: (1) specified by Tucson; and (2) subject to the “reasonable approval” of         Complainants. Tucson states that its obligation under section 5.1 was fulfilled when it         offered to transmit power to one or more points of interconnection that provide access to         transmission facilities owned by other utilities (i.e., Four Corners and San Juan). Tucson         asserts that section 5.1 of the FSA does not grant Complainants unfettered veto rights         over the points of delivery specified by Tucson. Tucson alleges that Complainants seek         to impose a greater obligation than that set forth in the 1992 FSA by demanding that                 7                   Id. at 16 (citing Ex. 3 (Mirich Aff.) ¶ 8).                 8                   Id. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                           -8-         Tucson deliver energy to one or more locations that are “commercially feasible,”         “commercially reasonable,” or “reasonably acceptable” to Complainants. Tucson notes         that the complaint uses the three terms interchangeably together with “reasonable         approval,” which is the actual term reflected in section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA. Thus,         Tucson states that the 1992 FSA only provides for Complainants “reasonable approval”         of the points of delivery specified.         16.     Tucson further argues that the complaint inappropriately relies on the 1982         Revenue Ruling and other contemporaneous documents. Tucson asserts that these         documents are irrelevant parol evidence because the terms of the 1992 FSA are clear and         unambiguous.9 Tucson argues that, even if the Commission were to conclude that this         extrinsic evidence should be considered here, these documents have little, if any,         probative value. Further, Tucson states that there is no evidence that the parties relied         upon, or even considered, these documents when entering into the 1992 FSA. Tucson         contends that: (1) although the term “commercially feasible” appears in the 1982         Revenue Ruling, the1982 Revenue Ruling is a specific ruling by the IRS for other         unrelated parties and circumstances and is not embodied in either the 1992 FSA or 1986         FSA; (2) all of these documents date from 1986, six years before the 1992 FSA was         executed; and (3) the original 1986 FSA did not impose on Tucson any post-lease         transmission obligations.         17.     Tucson states that, even if the Commission were to find that the term “reasonable         approval” under section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA equates to “commercially feasible,” or one         of the other terms used by Complainants, San Juan and Four Corners are both         commercially feasible points of delivery because both are liquid locations and the prices         at Four Corners for spot market transactions are similar to prices for energy traded at Palo         Verde.10                                  c.     Commission Determination         18.     We will deny the complaint on the basis that Complainants have not shown that         section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA requires Tucson to provide firm transmission service to Palo                 9                   Tucson Answer at 5 (citing Duquesne Light Co. et al., 138 FERC ¶ 61,111, at         P 25 (2012) (“[T]he Commission [has] found that, when the terms of a contract are clear         and unambiguous, the terms of the contract control and the Commission is not to consider         parol evidence to interpret the contract’s intention.”); Pac.

With regard to Complainants’ claim that Tucson is obligated to offer Palo Verde         as the delivery point, we find that the language in FSA section 5.1 is clear and         unambiguous and that the transmission service under the 1992 FSA is not dependent on         the point of interconnection being “commercially feasible,” as Complainants assert.         Nowhere in the 1992 FSA (where the parties first expressed a post-lease firm         transmission service obligation) does the term “commercially feasible” appear. To         support their assertion that they are entitled to a “commercially feasible” point of         delivery, Complainants submitted an affidavit to support their argument that, in setting up         the sale-and-leaseback transaction, the parties relied on the 1982 Revenue Ruling and         other contemporaneous documents. However, there are no statements in the 1986 or         1992 FSAs to support the argument that the parties relied on the 1982 Revenue Ruling or         contemporaneous documents in drafting and executing the 1992 FSA (i.e., the documents         are not mentioned or incorporated by reference in the 1992 FSA). Because the language         of the FSA is unambiguous, it is not appropriate for the Commission to consider extrinsic         evidence in interpreting the contract.13         20.      Furthermore, even if the Commission were to consider the extrinsic evidence         proffered by Complainants, we agree with Tucson that such evidence has little, if any,         probative value. We find that it would be inappropriate to rely on the 1982 Revenue         Ruling in interpreting the 1992 FSA, when the purpose of the 1986 ruling effectively         expired once the five-year depreciation period ended and the tax savings were realized         (i.e., in 1991). It also does not appear that the 1982 Revenue Ruling created any         condition or obligation applicable to Tucson, after expiration of the lease, to provide         transmission service to a specific point of delivery that the Complainants deemed                  11                     Given this determination, we dismiss as moot Complainants’ motion for partial         summary disposition.                  12                     1992 FSA § 5.1.                  13                     See, e.g., Duquesne Light Co. et al., 138 FERC ¶ 61,111 at P 25; Pac.

Additionally, we find that Complainants have not provided sufficient persuasive         evidence to support their allegation that the Four Corners and San Juan points of         interconnection are not “reasonably acceptable” because they are not “commercially         feasible.” Rather, Complainants simply state that the addition of their 195 MW of         capacity “would likely cause then preexisting prices at that location to plummet.”14                         2.    Allegations of OATT Violations                               a.     Complaint         22.     Complainants allege that Tucson has violated its OATT by failing to set aside         transmission for Complainants’ energy entitlements, as required by Tucson’s OATT         Attachment C (Available Transfer Capability Calculation Methodology). Specifically,         Complainants argue that, had Tucson set aside Complainants’ existing firm transmission         capacity, consistent with set-asides for grandfathered agreements that pre-date Tucson’s         OATT, there would be sufficient available transfer capability beginning on January 1,         2015 to transmit Complainants’ energy entitlement in Springerville 1 to Palo Verde,         which is Complainants’ preferred delivery point.15         23.     Complainants also argue that Complainants’ contractual rights to firm         transmission service reflected in the 1992 FSA are grandfathered by Order No. 88816 and         that Complainants therefore hold a right of first refusal to continue transmission service         for the capacity entitlement in Springerville Unit 1, upon expiration of the Lease         Agreements.17 They state that the Commission has previously found that: (1) a utility                 14                    Complaint, Ex. 3 (Mirich Aff.) ¶ 8b.                 15                    Id. at 21.                 16                    Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory         Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities         and Transmitting Utilities, Order No. 888, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,036 (1996), order         on reh’g, Order No. 888-A, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,048, order on reh’g, Order No.         888-B, 81 FERC ¶ 61,248 (1997), order on reh’g, Order No. 888-C, 82 FERC ¶ 61,046         (1998), aff’d in relevant part sub nom.

Complainants further state that their right of first refusal is not diminished by the fact that         the Tucson may want to “recall” existing capacity to meet anticipated growth in native         load.19         24.     Notwithstanding this policy, Complainants explain that Tucson is planning to use         capacity on the 345 kV transmission path from Springerville to Vail to transmit energy         from Gila River to the Tucson system beginning January 1, 2015. Complainants argue         that, by failing to set aside transmission capacity needed for Complainants’ transmission         service under the 1992 FSA, and instead using that capacity to serve native load, Tucson         is violating its OATT.20                                 b.     Answer         25.     Tucson argues that Complainants are incorrect that OATT Attachment C requires         Tucson to “set aside” transmission capacity for the 1992 FSA which Complainants assert         is a grandfathered agreement.21 Tucson disputes Complainants’ assertion that they hold a         right of first refusal for transmission capacity by virtue of section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA,         because Complainants are not an existing transmission customer and have never taken         transmission service from Tucson. Tucson additionally notes that the discussion in Order         No. 888 that Complainants reference was in the context of bundled service customers that         presumably have load obligations, not merchant generators seeking to transmit power.         Tucson argues that, even if Complainants qualify as existing customers of Tucson by         virtue of the 1992 FSA’s provision for future transmission service, a right of first refusal                 18                    Complaint at 21 (citing Tucson Elec.

Tucson         contends that, because the 1992 FSA is not a transmission service agreement and thus         does not specify a point of delivery,22 a right of first refusal does not attach. Tucson         notes that it has offered Complainants firm transmission service for Complainants’         energy entitlement to San Juan or Four Corners.23 Tucson argues that Complainants         essentially assert that Tucson should have set aside transmission capacity throughout         Tucson’s entire system on all possible paths, which would be contrary to the         Commission’s goal of promoting open access and run afoul of Commission policy         against transmission hoarding.24                                c.      Commission Determination         26.     We find that Tucson has not violated its OATT by not setting aside transfer         capability for Complainants. Importantly, Complainants do not hold a right of first         refusal for transmission from Springerville Unit 1 to Palo Verde because Complainants         are not a transmission customer of Tucson. The 1992 FSA only requires payments to         Tucson for transmission service and only addresses transmission service “[f]rom and         after the Lease Termination Date.”25 Complainants have not explained how, at the time         prior to the lease termination, they qualified as a transmission customer of Tucson.         Instead, it appears that, prior to the lease termination date, Tucson purchased         Complainants’ generation entitlement from Springerville Unit 1, which was designated as                 22                    Specifically, section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA states that Tucson will transmit         Complainants’ energy “to a point or points of interconnection specified from time to time         by Tucson subject to [Complainants’] reasonable approval (each, a ‘Point of         Interconnection’) with transmission facilities owned by another utility . . . .” 1992 FSA         § 5.1.                 23                    Tucson Answer at 20-21.                 24                    Id. at 22.                 25                    Section 5.1 of the FSA states that, “[f]rom and after the Lease Termination Date         with respect to [Complainants], Tucson shall wheel [Complainants’] Entitlement Share of         all Energy generated by [Springerville] Unit 1” and section 5.3 states that, “[f]rom and         after the Lease Termination Date in respect of [Complainant], Tucson shall be entitled to         payment from [Complainant] . . . .” 1992 FSA §§ 5.1, 5.3. Accordingly, under the 1992         FSA (and from statements in Tucson’s Answer), it appears that Complainants are only         obligated to pay for transmission service after the termination of the lease termination         date (i.e., January 1, 2015). 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                            - 13 -         a network resource, and used its transmission system to serve its native load. Thus, any         argument by Complainants that Commission policy requires Tucson to honor pre-existing         firm transmission service ahead of transmission service used to serve Tucson’s native         load is undermined by the fact that Complainants do not have pre-existing transmission         service. Therefore, Complainants do not possess a right of first refusal, or any type of         rollover rights, for firm transmission service.         27.      Moreover, assuming arguendo, that Complainants hold a right of first refusal for         transmission service under the 1992 FSA, the right of first refusal would be from         Springerville Unit 1 to the points of delivery stated in the agreement, which is essentially         “to a point or points of interconnection . . . with transmission facilities owned by another         utility . . . .”26 As Tucson points out, it would be illogical to expect Tucson to set aside         available transfer capability throughout Tucson’s entire system on all possible paths.         Moreover, as discussed above, there is no condition stated in the 1992 FSA that the point         of delivery must be “commercially feasible.” Therefore, a right of first refusal held by         Complainants would not be limited to the Springerville Unit 1 to Palo Verde path, as         claimed by Complainants. Instead, Complainants would hold a right of first refusal to the         point of delivery stated in the 1992 FSA—any point of interconnection with transmission         facilities owned by another utility—which Tucson has offered to Complainants.                           3.    Allegations of Undue Discrimination and Preference                                 a.     Complaint         28.      Complainants allege that Tucson, in using transmission capacity needed by         Complainants for other purposes, has violated sections 2.1, 5.1, and 5.4 of the FSA and is         engaging in undue discrimination and preference. Complainants state that Tucson has         filed a series of transmission service agreements with Salt River Project (the TSAs) for         provision of up to 623 MW of firm point-to-point bi-directional transmission service over         facilities that constitute a portion of the San Juan-Springerville-Vail Transmission System         (i.e., the Springerville to Coronado Line).27 Complainants point out that this transmission         service was arranged more than 10 years after Tucson agreed to provide transmission         service to Complainants in accordance with section 5.1 of the 1992 FSA.                  26                     1992 FSA § 5.1.                  27                     The San Juan-Springerville-Vail Transmission System is a network of         transmission facilities jointly owned by Tucson and PNM running from the San Juan         Generating Station in northwestern New Mexico to the Vail Substation in southeastern         Arizona. The Springerville to Coronado, which is part of the transmission system, is a         radial line off of the main line of the San Juan-Springerville-Vail transmission system         and runs from San Juan to Springerville. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                          - 14 -         29.     Complainants also state that Tucson is planning to use capacity in the 345 kV         transmission path from Springerville Unit 1 to Vail to transmit power from Gila River to         the Tucson system beginning January 1, 2015. Complainants assert that use of the         transmission path from Springerville to Vail for that purpose will have an adverse effect         on Complainants because Tucson has stated that there is no additional transmission         capacity available with which to transmit Complainants’ energy entitlement from         Springerville Unit 1 to Palo Verde.         30.     Complainants also argue that Tucson is violating its fiduciary duty under section         2.1 of the 1992 FSA by providing transmission service to Salt River Project.         Complainants argue that, under section 2.1 (Maintenance of Project Documents;         Alternate Operating Agreement) of the 1992 FSA, Tucson has a fiduciary duty to         Complainants and may not do anything that would have an adverse effect on them.         Complainants assert that use of the transmission capacity on the transmission path from         Springerville to Vail for Salt River Project will have an adverse effect on Complainants         because Tucson has stated that there is no additional firm transmission capacity available         to transmit Complainants’ energy entitlements from Springerville to Palo Verde.         Complainants argue that by using transmission capacity in a way that has an adverse         effect on Complainants, Tucson is violating its fiduciary duty to Complainants under         section 2.1.         31.     Complainants allege that, by denying Complainants firm transmission service         from Springerville Unit 1 to Palo Verde beginning on January 1, 2015, while at the same         time transmitting energy supplied by its own generation resources (including both its own         energy entitlement from Springerville Unit 1 and Gila River) over this same path, Tucson         is violating its obligation under section 5.1 to provide transmission service on a non-         discriminatory basis. Complainants further contend that section 5.4 (Service Continuity)         of the 1992 FSA also affirms that the non-discrimination provisions of the agreement are         intended to preclude Tucson from favoring its own energy entitlement from Springerville         Unit 1 or any other generating facility over Complainants’ energy entitlements in its         allocation of transmission capacity.         32.     Complainants next argue that the 1992 FSA provides for Complainants to pay for         transmission service provided by Tucson at rates that are “equal to . . . FERC-approved         rates.”28 Complainants state that Tucson has offered to provide transmission service to         Complainants at rates identical to those in its OATT; however, the transmission service         rates proposed in non-conforming TSAs with Salt River Project recently filed by Tucson                 28                    Complaint at 19 (citing 1992 FSA § 5.3). 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                            - 15 -         are “materially less than the rates in Tucson Electric’s OATT.”29 Complainants argue         that it is unreasonable and unduly discriminatory for Tucson to offer firm transmission         service to Salt River Project over the same portion of its transmission system as that         which would be used to deliver energy on behalf of Complainants at substantially lower         rates. Complainants contend that Tucson should be required to provide transmission         service to Palo Verde at discounted rates that are commensurate with rates charged to Salt         River Project.                                  b.     Answer         33.      Tucson notes that it and Salt River Project entered into certain TSAs as a         “stopgap” measure so that Salt River Project could transmit power to serve its load         pending the consummation of a transaction pursuant to which Tucson will sell an         undivided interest in the Springerville-Coronado Line to Salt River Project. Tucson         states that the rates under the TSAs reflect the costs that Salt River Project would incur as         a partial owner of the Springerville-Coronado Line and are part and parcel of that larger         transaction. Therefore, Tucson contends that no undue discrimination has occurred.         Moreover, Tucson notes that the points of receipt and delivery under the TSAs are not the         same as those sought by Complainants, and so, even were it not for the TSAs being         unique, Complainants would not be entitled to a similar rate.         34.       Specifically, Tucson asserts that transmission service on the Springerville-         Coronado Line over which Salt River Project takes service is a separate transmission path         from the transmission path from Springerville to Palo Verde over which Complainants         seek transmission service. Tucson states that it is factually incorrect to state that Salt         River Project is taking service over “the same portion of [the Tucson Electric]         transmission system” as that over which Complainants seek service. Moreover, Tucson         contends that it has not otherwise acted improperly in granting transmission service to         Salt River Project. Tucson states that Commission policy expressly permits discounting         of transmission service, and, consistent with this policy, Tucson agreed to provide service         to Salt River Project over the Springerville-Coronado Line at a rate based on Salt River         Project’s intent to become a partial owner of the line, and only over that discrete         transmission line. Thus, Tucson claims that, notwithstanding any discount offered or         provided by Tucson on the Springerville-Coronado Line, it is not required to offer or         provide that same discount (or even any similar discount) on the transmission path sought         by Complainants.                  29                     Id. at 20 (citing Tucson Transmittal, Docket No. ER15-124-000, at 7-8 (filed         Oct. 7, 2014)). 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                              - 16 -         35.     Further, Tucson disputes the allegation that Tucson has unduly discriminated         against Complainants, or violated section 2.1 of the 1992 FSA, by granting firm         transmission service to Salt River Project.30 Tucson explains that the path to Coronado         (Salt River Project path) and the path to Palo Verde (Complainants’ requested path)         radiate out in separate directions from Springerville (the former to the Northwest and the         latter to the South).31 Moreover, Tucson explains that the transmission rights awarded to         Salt River Project over the Springerville-Coronado Line had (and continue to have) no         bearing on the calculation of available transfer capability between Springerville and Palo         Verde because the Springerville-Coronado Line is essentially a radial line off of the         “trunk” that runs from San Juan to Springerville and then through Vail to Palo Verde.32         Tucson states that, even if Salt River Project had no transmission rights over the         Springerville-Coronado Line, there would still be no available transfer capability for firm         transmission from Springerville to Vail.         36.     Tucson also disputes Complainants’ claim that Tucson has unduly discriminated         against Complainants in favor of Tucson’s own generation. Tucson states that it requires         continued use of the Springerville to Vail portion of the Springerville to Palo Verde path         to serve its native load obligations, just as it has used that path since before it established         its OATT.         37.     Tucson states that, in order to compensate for the loss of generating capacity at         Springerville Unit 1(upon expiration of the Lease Agreements), it will acquire an interest         in Gila River located in Gila Bend, Arizona. This power, together with Tucson’s         ownership share of Springerville Unit 1, will utilize transmission capacity that has         historically been set aside for Tucson to move Springerville Unit 1 power to its service         territory in order to serve its native load and will necessarily use segments of the         transmission line that interconnects Springerville and Palo Verde―the same transmission         line over which Complainants seek transmission service.                 30                    Section 2.1 of the 1992 FSA states in pertinent part that “Tucson hereby         covenants and agrees . . . not to take any action, including any modification or         amendment to or waiver of the Project Documents, thereunder or permit any action to be         taken thereunder which would have any adverse effect on [Complainants] or on [their]         respective Undivided Interest.” 1992 FSA § 2.1.                 31                    Tucson Answer at 10 (citing map appended as Att. 2 (Aff. of Ed Beck), Ex. A).                 32                    Id. at 11 & Att. 2 (Aff. of Ed Beck) at 3-4. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                            - 17 -         38.     Tucson notes that this line has had zero available transfer capability since Tucson         first adopted an OATT in 1996, and therefore, Tucson has not “take[n] . . . transmission         capacity”33 on the Springerville to Palo Verde path in order transmit power from Gila         River to load. Rather, Tucson states that it has substituted certain of its Springerville         Unit 1 rights as a network resource with resources from Gila River in order to continue to         serve this same load. Tucson argues that its use of this transmission capacity is consistent         with the Commission’s recognition of the rights of load-serving entities to use         transmission to serve native load.34                                 c.    Commission Determination         39.     We find that Tucson has not engaged in undue discrimination or preference in         providing transmission service to Salt River Project because the transmission path         utilized by Salt River Project has no impact on available transfer capability over the         transmission path requested by Complainants. While transmission service from         Springerville-Coronado (the service provided to Salt River Project) and Springerville-         Palo Verde (the service requested by Complainants) share the same point of receipt, these         requests do not create competing transmission service because they require separate         paths. In fact, as Tucson explains, even if Salt River Project had no transmission rights         over the Springerville to Coronado path, there still would be no available transfer         capability for firm transmission service to meet Complainants’ transmission service         request. Accordingly, we find that Tucson’s actions in providing transmission service to         Salt River Project over a separate path did not have an adverse effect on Complainants         and did not constitute a violation of Tucson’s obligation to provide transmission service         on a non-discriminatory basis. Therefore, we find that Tucson did not violate sections         2.1, 5.1, or 5.4 of the 1992 FSA.         40.     We also find that Tucson’s transmission of generation over its transmission system         does not constitute “action . . . which would have any adverse effect on” Complainants,         in violation of section 2.1 of the 1992 FSA. As discussed above, prior to the lease         termination date, Tucson was purchasing Complainants’ generation from Springerville         Unit 1 and using its transmission system to serve its native load. Upon expiration of the         Lease Agreements, Tucson continues to transmit generation over its system from a new         network resource (i.e., Gila River) to serve its native load. Therefore, since it is         permissible for Tucson to designate network resources and use its transmission system to         serve native load in this manner, and since Complainants do not possess a right of first                 33                    Id. at 18 (quoting Complaint at 3-4).                 34                    Id. at 18-19. 20150219-3009 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/19/2015         Docket No. EL15-17-000                                                           - 18 -         refusal, or any type of rollover rights, for firm transmission service, we find that Tucson         has not violated sections 2.1, 5.1, or 5.4 of the 1992 FSA.         41.    In addition, we will deny Complainants’ request for the same discounted rates         charged to Salt River Project because Complainants request transmission service over a         different path, to a different point of delivery, than Salt River.35 Tucson’s OATT only         requires Tucson to offer the same discounted rate to customers on unconstrained         transmission paths with the same point of delivery, which is not the case here.         The Commission orders:                (A)     The complaint is hereby denied, as discussed in the body of this order.                (B) Complainants’ motion for partial summary disposition is hereby dismissed         as moot, as discussed in the body of this order.         By the Commission.

In addition to the authorizations requested pursuant to FPA section 203 for         approval of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, the ITC Applicants seek approval pursuant to         FPA section 205 of a proposed company-specific Attachment O formula rate template to         the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO)8 Open Access         Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff (MISO Tariff) for the four         new operating companies that will hold the Entergy transmission facilities after the         Entergy-ITC Transaction closes (the New ITC Operating Companies).9 This formula rate         template is referred to as the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O         formula rate in this order. In addition to approval of the formula rate, Applicants also         request approval of several new rate schedules under the MISO Tariff, and several         jurisdictional agreements. Applicants state that the proposed rate construct is integral to         the Entergy-ITC Transaction, and that the proposed formula rate, rate schedules and         jurisdictional agreements included in the Application will provide the Commission with a         “complete picture” of the Entergy-ITC Transaction.10         4.      On January 18, 2013, pursuant to FPA section 205 and Part 35 of the         Commission’s regulations, the New ITC Operating Companies filed an application         seeking Commission approval of their proposed accounting and ratemaking treatment for         certain pension and post-retirement welfare (OPEB) plan costs that relate to the         approximately 750 employees of Entergy that will become ITC Holdings employees as         part of the Entergy-ITC Transaction (OPEB Filing).11                 8                   Effective April 26, 2013, MISO changed its name from “Midwest Independent         Transmission System Operator, Inc.” to “Midcontinent Independent System Operator,         Inc.”                 9                   The pro forma MISO Attachment O formula rate template was approved in         Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., 84 FERC ¶ 61,231, order on         reconsideration, 85 FERC ¶ 61,250, order on reh’g, 85 FERC ¶ 61,372 (1998); Midwest         Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., 87 FERC ¶ 61,189 (1999).                 10                    Application at 2. According to Applicants, MISO joins the Application as         “Administrator of the MISO Tariff and as a signatory to the Appendix I Agreement         submitted [with the Application] for acceptance, but otherwise takes no position on the         substance of [the Application].” Application at 3.                 11                    Accounting and Ratemaking Treatment for Pension and OPEB Costs, Docket         No. ER13-782-000 (Jan. 18, 2013). Applicants explain that these employees will help         staff and manage the New ITC Operating Companies. OPEB Filing at 2. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 -6-         5.      On February 15, 2013, pursuant to FPA section 205 and Part 35 of the         Commission’s regulations, MISO and Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy Services), on         behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, filed company-specific Attachment O         formula rate templates to the MISO Tariff for each of the Entergy Operating Companies         (TPZ Filing). These formula rate templates are referred to as the Entergy Operating         Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates in this order. As explained in further         detail below, the Entergy Operating Companies state that the rates proposed in the TPZ         Filing would be used in the event that the Entergy-ITC Transaction fails to close and         Entergy retains its transmission assets. The Entergy Operating Companies explain that if         the Entergy-ITC Transaction does close, these rates will be used by the New ITC         Operating Companies to bill for transmission service during the interim period from the         date that the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes to the date that the Entergy transmission         system is fully integrated into MISO, which is expected to occur December 19, 2013,         subject to true-up. The Entergy Operating Companies also propose to establish         four transmission pricing zones in MISO.         6.      This order addresses Applicants’ requests pursuant to FPA section 205 in the         Application, the OPEB Filing, and the TPZ Filing. With the exception of certain issues         that are summarily resolved below, in this order we set for hearing and establish         settlement judge procedures for certain aspects of the New ITC Operating Companies and         Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates; the proposed rate         schedules; certain of the proposed agreements filed pursuant to FPA section 205; and the         OPEB Filing. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the requests and proposals being         set for hearing and settlement judge procedures have not been shown to be just and         reasonable and may be unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential, or         otherwise unlawful. We find that, except for the issues summarily resolved below, these         requests and proposals raise issues of material fact that cannot be resolved based on the         record before us, and are more appropriately addressed in the hearing and settlement         judge procedures ordered below.         I.      Background                 A.      Entergy’s Integration into MISO and the Entergy-ITC Transaction         7.      In April 2011, Entergy announced its intention to join MISO as a Transmission         Owner effective December 19, 2013, subject to receiving the necessary regulatory         approvals.12 Eight months later, while MISO was taking preparatory steps towards                 12                    Filing of Pro Forma Tariff Sheets Including Proposed Module B-1 to MISO’s         Tariff, Transmittal Letter at 2, Docket No. ER12-2682-000 (filed Sept. 24, 2012)         (Module B-1 Filing). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  -7-         integrating Entergy into MISO, Entergy and ITC Holdings announced their proposal to         separate Entergy’s jurisdictional transmission facilities into six separate “wires-only”         transmission subsidiaries of Entergy Mid South, a newly-formed subsidiary holding         company of Entergy, to spin-off the ownership interests of Entergy Mid South to         Entergy’s shareholders, and then to merge Entergy Mid South with ITC Midsouth, a         newly-formed subsidiary holding company of ITC Holdings.13 In order to meet both of         these goals, the proposed integration of Entergy into MISO and the transfer of Entergy’s         transmission facilities to ITC Holdings through the proposed merger, Entergy, ITC         Holdings, and MISO devised a “phased approach.”14         8.      The first phase of this process involves several Commission filings by MISO, ITC         Holdings and Entergy to effectuate the transfer of Entergy’s transmission assets to the         New ITC Operating Companies and to create an appropriate tariff mechanism to be         known as Module B-1 for MISO’s provision of transmission service on these facilities         during the time after the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes and before integration of the         generation and load within Entergy’s footprint into MISO’s energy and operating         reserves markets (Interim Period). Among these filings are the Application, the TPZ         Filing and the OPEB Filing.15 Also related to this group of filings is the Module B-1         Filing, wherein MISO proposes the terms and conditions pursuant to which MISO would         provide transmission service over the Entergy transmission facilities immediately after         closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction until Entergy’s full integration into MISO. Other         related filings include a filing to terminate Service Schedule MSS-2 of the Entergy         System Agreement,16 and a filing to establish a tariff for Entergy to provide ancillary         services, including imbalance and regulation services.17                 13                    Id.                 14                    Id.                 15                    Separate requests for authorizations under FPA section 204 to facilitate the         Entergy-ITC Transaction were also filed in Docket Nos. ES13-5-000, ES13-6-000,         ES11-40-002 (Section 204 Applications). The Commission approved these requests on         May 16, 2013. See ITC Arkansas LLC, 143 FERC ¶ 61,123 (2013); Entergy Arkansas,         Inc., 143 FERC ¶ 61,124 (2013); Transmission Company Arkansas, LLC, 143 FERC         ¶ 61,125 (2013).                 16                    Notice of Cancellation of Service Schedule MSS-2 under the Entergy System         Agreement upon Consummation of Spin-Merger of Entergy Operating Companies’         Transmission Business to ITC, Docket No. ER12-2693-000 (filed Sept. 26, 2012).         Service Schedule MSS-2 concerns transmission equalization under the Entergy System         Agreement. The System Agreement is a Commission-approved tariff that currently                                                                                        (continued…) 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  -8-         9.      In addition to this order, the Commission is issuing concurrently three other orders         addressing these related filings. As noted above, this order addresses Applicants’         requests pursuant to FPA section 205 that were filed as part of the Application; the TPZ         Filing; and the OPEB Filing. The other orders address:                 (1) Applicants’ request for approval of the Entergy-ITC Transaction under FPA                 section 203, and the Entergy Applicants’ petition for a declaratory order that                 certain steps in the Entergy-ITC Transaction do not violate FPA section 305(a);18                 (2) the Module B-1 Filing;19 and                 (3) the filing to cancel Service Schedule MSS-2 of the System Agreement.20                 B.     Overview of the Filings                        1.      The Application                                a.     The New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O                                       Formula Rates         10.     As noted above, in addition to seeking approval under FPA section 203 for the         Entergy-ITC Transaction in the Application, Applicants also seek approval under FPA         section 205 for the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate,         several new rates schedules under the MISO Tariff, and several agreements. According         to the ITC Applicants, the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula         rate template is a transmission rate construct that will be used for each of the New ITC         Operating Companies – ITC Arkansas LLC, ITC Louisiana LLC, ITC Mississippi LLC,         requires the Entergy Operating Companies’ generation and transmission facilities to be         operated as a single integrated operating system.                 17                    Entergy Services, Inc.

The ITC Applicants explain that, if the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes, the         New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate will go into effect and         be used to calculate the rates for transmission service over the transmission facilities of         the New ITC Operating Companies (i.e., the former Entergy transmission facilities).24         The formula rate has three components: (1) the formula itself (including a statement of         the annual transmission revenue requirement including the true-up and unit cost rate);25                 21                    Application at 49. As part of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, ITC Holdings         intends to combine the transmission businesses of Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States         and Entergy New Orleans into a single operating company, ITC Louisiana LLC.         Application at 17.                 22                    Id. at 49. According to Applicants, the creation of ITC Louisiana LLC aligns         with the scope of the Louisiana transmission pricing zone that was proposed in the TPZ         Filing. Application, Exhibit No. ITC-200: Prepared Direct Testimony of Cameron M.         Bready on Behalf of ITC Holdings Corp. at 30:14-15 (Bready Test.).                 23                    Id. at 49.                 24                    Id. If the Entergy-ITC Transaction does not close before December 19, 2013,         the anticipated date of the Entergy Operating Companies’ integration into MISO, the         New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate will not go into effect         because the transmission facilities will remain with Entergy. If the Entergy-ITC         Transaction closes after December 19, 2013, the Entergy Operating Companies MISO         Attachment O formula rates would go into effect on December 19, 2013, and remain in         effect until closing, at which time the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment         O formula rate would go into effect. If the Entergy-ITC Transaction does not close, the         New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate would be mooted by         events as ITC Holdings would not obtain the Entergy transmission facilities.                 25                    Application, Exhibit No. ITC-400: Prepared Direct Testimony of Alan C. Heintz         on Behalf of ITC Holdings Corp. (Heintz Test.) at 8. The pro forma Attachment O         formula rate template is attached to the Application as Attachment 3. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 10 -         (2) the implementation protocols, which describe how the formula will be updated each         year;26 and (3) the true-up methodology, which accounts for differences between the         projected costs under the forward-looking formula rate and the actual costs incurred.27         The ITC Applicants state that the rate construct includes the use of the 12.38 percent         return on equity (ROE) that is currently available to all Transmission Owners in MISO;         “an actual capital structure targeting 60 percent equity and 40 percent debt”;28 and the         implementation of MISO Attachment O on a forward-looking basis with a true-up         mechanism.29 The ITC Applicants state that Commission approval of these three aspects         of the rate construct are essential to effect the Entergy-ITC Transaction.30 The ITC         Applicants contend that the Commission’s failure to approve this rate construct will         jeopardize the Entergy-ITC Transaction and risk loss of the benefits associated with         independent ownership of Entergy’s transmission facilities.31         12.     The ITC Applicants state that the New ITC Operating Companies MISO         Attachment O formula rates are comparable to existing, approved formula rates for         Transmission Owners in MISO.32 Additionally, the ITC Applicants assert that the         proposed rate construct has been viewed favorably by investors and rating agencies due         to its ability to provide steady and predictable cash flows.33 The ITC Applicants state         that the proposed rate construct is expected to result in high investment grade credit         ratings for the New ITC Operating Companies, and corresponding access to capital                 26                    The proposed pro forma implementation protocols are attached to the         Application as Attachment 4 and are described in Applicants’ witness testimony.

The true-up methodologies are established in Attachment 6         to the Application, Pro Forma Attachment GG Annual True-up Procedure.                 28                    Id.                 29                    The ITC Applicants state that this proposal is consistent with the treatment of         other independent transmission companies in MISO. Id.                 30                    Id. at 50.                 31                    Id. The ITC Applicants describe the benefits of the requested rate construct in         enabling ITC Holdings to invest in the transmission system in witness testimony.                 32                    Id. at 50.                 33                    Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 11 -         markets for financing and favorable cost of debt.34 The ITC Applicants further assert that         the proposed rate construct will enable substantial investment of capital into the         transmission systems.35 The ITC Applicants note that approval of the rate construct         proposed by the New ITC Operating Companies will result in the introduction of         independent transmission ownership with the desire and ability to invest in needed         transmission to a new region of the country.36 The ITC Applicants conclude that the         proposed formula rate is comparable to formula rates previously approved by this         Commission, and for the reasons discussed above, is just and reasonable.37 The ITC         Applicants request that the effective date of the tariff sheets to implement the New ITC         Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates and the proposed rate schedules         and jurisdictional agreements be deferred until the closing date of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction.38                                b.    Proposed Rate Schedules under the MISO Tariff         13.    Applicants explain that the change in ownership of the transmission assets from         Entergy to ITC Holdings creates certain unique rate issues related to the historical         treatment of certain ratemaking items in the Entergy Open Access Transmission Tariff         (OATT) formula rates. Applicants propose several rate schedules to address these issues.         14.    First, the New ITC Operating Companies would recover the costs of Supplemental         Upgrades under proposed Schedule 40.39 Applicants state that the cost of Supplemental         Upgrades (i.e., economic upgrades) funded by the Entergy Operating Companies on         behalf of their bundled retail load is recovered only through bundled retail rates, not from         Entergy’s wholesale transmission customers through Entergy’s OATT rates. Applicants         explain that, although the New ITC Operating Companies will own these upgrades         following the closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, the cost of these facilities will not         be rolled into their transmission rates. Instead, the New ITC Operating Companies will         recover the costs associated with these upgrades directly from the Entergy Operating         Companies through a separate schedule to the MISO Tariff, proposed Schedule 40.                34                   Id.                35                   Id.                36                   Id. at 54.                37                   Id.                38                   Id. at 81.                39                   Id. at 55. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 12 -         15.      Second, Applicants propose Schedule 41 to recover securitized storm restoration                40         costs. Applicants explain that the Entergy Operating Companies securitized storm         restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike, and a 2009 ice storm in         Arkansas. The costs of the securitized assets were removed from the books of the         affected Entergy Operating Companies, and the Entergy OATT formula rate does not         include any charges for the recovery of the securitized assets. Applicants state that,         pursuant to settlement agreements approved by the Commission, the applicable Entergy         Operating Companies are authorized to recover in wholesale rates from wholesale         customers taking service under the Entergy OATT their share of the transmission portion         of the storm restoration costs for these hurricanes and the ice storms. Given that Entergy         will no longer have an OATT rate in effect if the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes,         Applicants propose Schedule 41 to the MISO Tariff to continue the current treatment and         bill the annual storm securitization charges.         16.      Third, Applicants propose Schedule 42-A to collect charges for accrued interest         for transmission customer prepayments through the New ITC Operating Companies         MISO Attachment O formula rate.41 Applicants explain that the Commission’s general         policy is that, when a generator pays for upgrades located “at or beyond” the point of         interconnection to the transmission grid, it is entitled to transmission credits, with         interest, because these are network upgrades. According to Applicants, the Entergy         Operating Companies recorded the Allowance for Funds Used During Construction         (AFUDC) associated with these network upgrades and originally included such AFUDC         in transmission in calculating their annual rate update, but, as part of a Commission         settlement,42 the Entergy Operating Companies agreed to remove this capitalized         AFUDC from the annual rate update calculation. As a result, AFUDC associated with         the network upgrades was deleted from transmission plant for purposes of calculating         transmission rates.43 Applicants explain that all of the accrued interest portion associated         with transmission credits paid or credited to customers that made prepayments for         transmission facilities is treated as a deferred asset and added to the Entergy Operating         Companies’ rate base calculation for purposes of the annual rate update calculation.         Similar to the approach with securitization, charges from wholesale customers for         accrued interest for transmission customer prepayments would be collected under         Schedule 42-A.                  40                     Id. at 56-57.                  41                     Id. at 57-58.                  42                     Applicants refer to a settlement in Docket No. ER04-886-000.                  43                     Application at 57. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 13 -         17.     Finally, similar to Schedule 42-A, Applicants propose Schedule 42-B to continue         to include credits to wholesale customers for AFUDC associated with generator         interconnection prepayments in the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O         formula rate.44                                c.     Proposed Agreements         18.     In addition to the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula         rate and the proposed rate schedules, Applicants also request approval of an agreement         under Appendix I of the MISO Transmission Owners Agreement (MISO TOA), and         several ancillary agreements.         19.     Applicants explain that the New ITC Operating Companies will sign the MISO         TOA, and that the New ITC Operating Companies and MISO will enter into an         agreement under Appendix I of the MISO TOA (the Appendix I Agreement). Applicants         state that the Appendix I Agreement provides for the operation of independent         transmission companies such as the New ITC Operating Companies in MISO, and allows         for the assignment to an independent transmission company certain responsibilities that         would otherwise belong to MISO.45         20.     In addition to the Appendix I Agreement, ITC Holdings and Entergy will enter         into two transition service agreements that provide for transition services between the         relevant operating companies upon consummation of the Entergy-ITC Transaction.         Applicants state that these agreements are intended to facilitate the transfer of the         transmission business from Entergy to ITC Holdings. According to Applicants, under         one agreement, Entergy will provide services to the New ITC Operating Companies in         the areas of field support services, engineering support services, site access services, and         corporate support services; under the other agreement, ITC Holdings will provide these         same services to the Entergy Operating Companies. Applicants state that both         agreements have a one-year term, renewable for up to two six-month periods, and that         services under both agreements will be provided at cost, with no profit margin.46         21.     Applicants also submit for approval the Distribution-Transmission Interconnection         Agreement, which provides for the interconnection of the New ITC Operating         Companies’ transmission facilities with the Entergy Operating Companies’ distribution                 44                    Id. at 58.                 45                    Id. at 60.                 46                    Id. at 68-69. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 14 -         facilities and establishes the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties related         to that interconnection, including the obligation for the parties to operate their facilities in         accordance with Good Utility Practice, applicable reliability standards, and applicable         regional transmission organization (RTO) requirements.         22.     The Entergy Operating Companies, ITC Holdings, and MISO have also filed a         form of Generator Interconnection Agreement to govern the continued interconnection         and operation of Entergy’s existing generating facilities with the New ITC Operating         Companies’ transmission systems. Applicants state that a separate Generator         Interconnection Agreement will be executed for each Entergy Operating Company to         govern the continued interconnection and operation of the existing generating facilities.         23.     Applicants also request approval of a Pole Attachment Agreement for Electric         Distribution Facilities. Applicants state that this agreement provides for the attachment         of existing and future Entergy-owned distribution facilities to and upon certain poles,         towers, substations and other multi-use transmission structures transferred to ITC         Holdings under the Entergy-ITC Transaction. The agreement also provides for the         attachment of ITC Holdings’ transmission facilities to and upon Entergy distribution         structures.         24.     Lastly, Applicants request approval of a Transmission Structure Attachment         Agreement for Telecommunications Facilities. Applicants state that this agreement         defines the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the New ITC Operating Companies         and the Entergy Operating Companies relative to telecommunications lines that are         owned by the Entergy Operating Companies and that are attached to transmission         facilities that will be transferred to the New ITC Operating Companies under the         Entergy-ITC Transaction.                         2.      The TPZ Filing         25.     In the TPZ Filing, the Entergy Operating Companies request approval of the         Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates. As with the New ITC         Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate, the Entergy Operating         Companies propose to adopt MISO’s current Commission-approved transmission         formula rate template in Attachment O of the MISO Tariff with certain company-specific         revisions. According to the TPZ Filing, the purpose of these revisions is to continue the         historical treatment of certain ratemaking items in the Entergy OATT formula rates. The         Entergy Operating Companies request that the Commission accept the proposed         Attachment O formula rates and other proposed revisions to become effective when the 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 15 -         Entergy Operating Companies fully integrate into MISO, which is scheduled for         December 19, 2013, unless the Entergy-ITC Transaction has closed by that date.47         26.     The Entergy Operating Companies propose ten categories of company-specific         changes to the Commission-approved MISO pro forma formula rate to address: (1)         supplemental upgrades previously addressed in Attachment T to the Entergy OATT;         (2) securitized storm damage costs; (3) AFUDC associated with independent power         producers prepayments; (4) interest on independent power producers prepayments;         (5) the inclusion of payroll changes from Entergy Services and Entergy Operations, Inc.         in the wages and salary allocator; (6) Accumulated Deferred Income Tax (ADIT)         adjustments; (7) excess deferred income taxes; (8) a permanent income tax adjustment;         (9) credits under section 30.9 of the MISO Tariff;48 and (10) FERC Form No. 1 page         reference for peak load.49         27.     In the TPZ Filing, the Entergy Operating Companies also propose to establish         four transmission pricing zones within MISO: one for the Entergy Texas transmission         facilities; one for the Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New                 47                    As noted earlier, if the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes before December 19,         2013, the Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates will not go         into effect. Rather, transmission service would be provided under the New ITC         Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate. If, however, the Entergy-ITC         Transaction closes after December 19, 2013, the Entergy Operating Companies MISO         Attachment O formula rates would go into effect on December 19, 2013 and remain in         effect until the date of closing, at which time the New ITC Operating Companies MISO         Attachment O formula rate would go into effect. If the Entergy-ITC Transaction does not         close, the Entergy ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates would         go into effect on December 19, 2013 and remain in effect thereafter.                 48                    Section 30.9 of the MISO Tariff relates to credits for Network Customers that         own existing transmission facilities that are integrated into the MISO transmission         system.                 49                    TPZ Filing at 5. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 16 -         Orleans transmission facilities;50 one for the Entergy Arkansas transmission facilities; and         one for the Entergy Mississippi transmission facilities.51                         3.     The OPEB Filing         28.     In the OPEB Filing, the New ITC Operating Companies propose accounting and         rate treatment for certain pension and post-retirement welfare plan costs. The New ITC         Operating Companies explain that, as part of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, approximately         750 Entergy employees will become employees of ITC Holdings, and help staff and         manage the New ITC Operating Companies.52 The New ITC Operating Companies         explain that, under the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate,         they will recover their transmission revenue requirements, including compensation and         benefit related expenses, on a current basis, with a true-up mechanism designed so         transmission customers only pay amounts that correspond to actual revenue         requirements.53 The New ITC Operating Companies explain that the template for this         rate includes pension and OPEB costs, thereby allowing recovery of pension and OPEB         plan employee costs associated with services provided to ITC Holdings post-closing of         the Entergy-ITC Transaction.54                 50                    As noted above, ITC Holdings intends to consolidate these transmission         facilities under one operating company, ITC Louisiana LLC.                 51                    TPZ Filing at 17-19. The TPZ Filing also includes revisions to Schedule 7         (Long-Term Firm and Short-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service), Schedule 8         (Non-firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service), Schedule 9 (Network Integration         Transmission Service), Schedule 26 (Network Upgrade Charge from Transmission         Expansion Plan), and the preamble to Attachment O (Rate Formulae) of the MISO Tariff         to make appropriate references to the proposed four transmission pricing zones and the         Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates.                 52                    OPEB Filing at 2. The Employee Matters Agreement, which is included as         Exhibit No. I-3 to the Application, allocates among ITC Holdings and Entergy “certain         assets, liabilities and responsibilities regarding employee matters, benefits and         programs.” Application at 14.                 53                    OPEB Filing at 2.                 54                    OPEB Filing at 2. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 17 -         29.     The New ITC Operating Companies state that the use of purchase accounting for         the Entergy-ITC Transaction makes the OPEB Filing necessary because ITC Holdings         will need to record liabilities that include previously unrecovered pension and OPEB         costs that would not otherwise be recovered in rates.55 For this reason, the New ITC         Operating Companies seek Commission approval to create, amortize over time, and         recover in rates regulatory assets related to previously unrecovered pension and OPEB         costs.56         II.

III.    Discussion                 A.      Procedural Matters         37.     Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,61 the         notices of intervention and timely, unopposed motions to intervene serve to make the         entities that filed them parties to these proceedings. Pursuant to Rule 214(d) of the         Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,62 we will grant the late-filed motions to                 60                    See generally Entergy Retail Regulators Feb. 26 Motion for Extension of         Comment Deadline, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 61                    18 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2012).                 62                    18 C.F.R. § 385.214(d) (2012). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 19 -         intervene given intervenors’ interests in the proceeding, the early stages of the         proceeding, and the absence of undue prejudice or delay.         38.     Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure 63 prohibits an         answer to a protest or answer unless otherwise ordered by the decisional authority. We         will accept the answers filed in this proceeding because they have provided information         that assisted us in our decision-making process.         39.     Some protestors request that the Commission consolidate consideration of the         Application with various other proceedings,64 and some parties also request that the         Commission set the Application for hearing.65 The Commission’s practice is to         consolidate proceedings where the issues are closely intertwined with each other.66 The         Commission finds that the issues that have been raised with respect to Applicants’ FPA         section 205 requests in the Application, the TPZ Filing, and the OPEB Filing are closely         interrelated, and this warrants consideration of these three proceedings jointly for         purposes of settlement, hearing and decision. Consequently, the Commission will         consolidate these proceedings for purposes of settlement, hearing and decision, as         discussed further below. In addition, as discussed in further detail below, the         Commission is setting various issues relating to these filings for hearing and establishing         settlement judge procedures.                 63                    18 C.F.R. ¶ 385.213(a)(2) (2012).                 64                    See, e.g., Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 117, Docket         No. ER12-2681-000.                 65                    See, e.g., Texas Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 15, Docket         No. ER12-2681-000; Louisiana Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 2, Docket         No. ER12-2681-000.                 66                    Missouri River Energy Servs., 124 FERC ¶ 61,309, at P 39 (2008); Public         Service Company of New Mexico, 142 FERC ¶ 61,168, at P 19 (2013). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 20 -                 B.      Substantive Issues                         1.     Issues Set for Hearing                                a.     Protests         40.     Protestors raise a number of issues with the proposed formula rates, and certain of         the proposed related schedules and agreements.67 A majority of the protestors request a         hearing on the formula rate templates and related agreements.68 For example, Joint         Customers argue that Applicants’ requested rate construct should not be approved         because the formula rate: inappropriately includes the costs of retail radial lines;69         inappropriately includes post-Order No. 2003 interconnection facilities;70 fails to reduce         rate base for unfunded reserves;71 and fails to properly weight income taxes.72         Additionally, Joint Customers take issue with the two Transition Service Agreements,         arguing that the agreements contain no rates or charges, and that there is no provision for         Joint Customers to question the charges, access the data underlying the invoices, or audit         the charges under the agreements.73         41.     Protestors also raise issues with the Pole Attachment Agreement for Electric         Distribution Facilities and the Transmission Structure Attachment Agreement for         Telecommunications Facilities. For example, Joint Customers argue that the New ITC                 67                    We note that there are many common issues of fact between the New ITC         Operating Companies and Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula         rates, which are identical in most respects, as relevant to both the vertically-integrated         Entergy Operating Companies and the transmission-only new ITC Operating Companies.                 68                    The parties requesting a hearing on the formula rate issues include Associated         Electric, Joint Customers, the Louisiana Commission, the Kansas Commission, the City         of New Orleans, and the Texas Commission.                 69                    Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 49, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 70                    Id. at 51.                 71                    Id. at 52.                 72                    Id. at 53.                 73                    Id. at 110-111; Joint Customers Mar.11 Answer at 47-48, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 21 -         Operating Companies should be required to charge the Entergy Operating Companies         attachment fees for both existing and new facilities attached to ITC structures.74 Joint         Customers assert that, otherwise, the Entergy Operating Companies would benefit,         without compensation to ITC, from existing structure attachments, and that such benefit         is in the form of avoidance of distribution facilities investments (i.e., stand-alone         distribution poles).         42.     Similarly, Joint Customers assert that the Entergy Operating Companies’ proposed         Attachment O formula rates are flawed and should not be approved unless modified.75         Joint Customers argue that the Commission should reject as unjust and unreasonable the         Entergy Operating Companies’ “cherry-picking” approach to establish a formula rate for         the companies upon their integration into MISO.76 Specifically, Joint Customers argue         that: the use of the pro forma Attachment O formula rate template with limited Entergy-         proposed modifications is unjust and unreasonable;77 retail radial lines should be         excluded from transmission plant;78 the formula rate fails to reduce rate base for         unfunded reserves;79 transmission costs are inflated due to the failure to account for         distribution under-build facilities on transmission poles and towers;80 the proposed         formula rate does not reflect all appropriate revenue credits;81 the proposed formula rate         inappropriately includes post-Order No. 2003 interconnection facilities;82 the proposed                 74                    Joint Customers Jan. 22Protest of Application at 115-116, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 75                    Joint Customers Mar. 22 Protest of TPZ Filing at 4, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 76                    Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 4, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 77                    Joint Customers Mar. Protest of TPZ Filing at 4, Docket No. ER13-948-000.         Joint Customers allege that additional modifications beyond what Entergy proposed are         necessary to make the proposed formula rate just and reasonable.                 78                    Id. at 6.                 79                    Id. at 10.                 80                    Id. at 12.                 81                    Id. at 14.                 82                    Id. at 16. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                    - 22 -         formula rate is wrongly based on end-of-year balances;83 prepayments included in rate         base must exclude retail costs;84 Entergy’s inclusion of certain accumulated deferred         income taxes is contrary to Commission precedent;85 and Entergy’s permanent         differences tax adjustment is unsupported.86         43.     Protestors also take issue with the OPEB Filing. Joint Customers, for example,         argue that the wide-ranging estimates for pension and OPEB regulatory assets         demonstrate that the requested approvals are premature.87 Joint Customers also argue         that the OPEB Filing raises a number of unanswered questions regarding the requested         regulatory asset approval.88 For instance, Joint Customers contend that granting the New         Operating Companies pre-approval of certain formula rate template components without         specific cost information is inappropriate and could prevent interested parties from         challenging the actuarial valuations once available.89 Joint Customers argue further that         the OPEB Filing violates the Commission’s Post-Employment Benefits Other than         Pensions Statement of Policy90 and also fails to include the studies necessary for the         Commission to review the New Operating Companies’ proposed treatment of pension         and OPEB costs.                                b.     Commission Determination         44.     We find that the proposed Attachment O formula rates for the New ITC Operating         Companies and the Entergy Operating Companies, Schedules 40, 41, 42-A, and 42-B,         and certain related agreements filed by Applicants,91 as well as the OPEB Filing, except                 83                    Id. at 17.                 84                    Id. at 19.                 85                    Id. at 22.                 86                    Id. at 23.                 87                    Joint Customers Protest of OPEB Filing at 9.                 88                    Id.                 89                    Id.                 90                    Post-Employment Benefits Other Than Pensions, 61 FERC ¶ 61,330 (1992),         order denying reh’g and granting clarification in part, 65 FERC ¶ 61,035 (1993).                 91                    Specifically, protestors raised issues of material fact with respect to the Pole         Attachment Agreement for Electric Distribution Facilities and the Transmission Structure                                                                                          (continued…) 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 23 -         for the issues summarily resolved below, raise issues of material fact that cannot be         resolved based on the record before us, and are more appropriately addressed in the         hearing and settlement judge procedures ordered below.         45.     Our preliminary analysis indicates that the proposed Attachment O formula         rates for the New ITC Operating Companies and the Entergy Operating Companies,         Schedules 40, 41, 42-A, and 42-B, and certain related agreements filed by Applicants, as         well as the OPEB Filing, have not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be         unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential, or otherwise unlawful.         Therefore, we accept for filing, suspend, and make effective subject to refund the New         ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate, Schedules 40, 41, 42-A,         and 42-B and certain related agreements proposed in the Application, and the OPEB         Filing, to become effective on the date that the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes, as         requested. We also accept for filing, suspend, and make effective subject to refund the         Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates, to become effective on         December 19, 2013, unless the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes prior to that date, in         which case the New ITC Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates will         go into effect. We also establish hearing and settlement judge procedures in these         proceedings. In addition, given the common issues of fact and law, we will consolidate         them for purposes of settlement, hearing, and decision.         46.     While we are setting these matters for a trial-type evidentiary hearing, we         encourage the parties to make every effort to settle their disputes before hearing         procedures are commenced. To aid the parties in their settlement efforts, we will hold the         hearing in abeyance and direct that a settlement judge be appointed, pursuant to Rule 603         of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure.92 If the parties desire, they may,         by mutual agreement, request a specific judge as the settlement judge in the proceeding;         otherwise, the Chief Judge will select a judge for this purpose.93 The settlement judge         shall report to the Chief Judge and the Commission within thirty (30) days of the date of         this order concerning the status of settlement discussions. Based on this report, the Chief         Attachment Agreement for Telecommunications Facilities; and the Transition Service         Agreements.                 92                    18 C.F.R § 385.603 (2012).                 93                    If the parties decide to request a specific judge, they must make their joint         request to the Chief Judge by telephone at (202) 502-8500 within five days of this order.         The Commission's website contains a list of Commission judges available for settlement         proceedings and a summary of their background and experience         (http://www.ferc.gov/legal/adr/avail-judge.asp). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 24 -         Judge shall provide the parties with additional time to continue their settlement         discussions or provide commencement of a hearing by assigning the case to a presiding         judge.                         2.    Issues Summarily Resolved                               a.      ROE                                       i.     Proposal         47.     Applicants contend that the New ITC Operating Companies are entitled to use the         current 12.38 percent MISO ROE because they will be Transmission Owners in MISO. 94         They further assert that the New ITC Operating Companies’ ROE must be similar to that         of other MISO companies in order to have efficient access to capital. 95 The Entergy         Operating Companies also propose to use the current 12.38 percent MISO ROE in the         Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates.96         48.     Applicants state that ITC Holdings is not requesting any transmission rate         incentives for the New ITC Operating Companies but reserves the right to request, in the         future, as may become necessary, transmission rate incentives for the New ITC Operating         Companies, including an incentive adder for independent transmission companies.97                 94                    Application at 50 (citing DATC Midwest Holdings, LLC, 139 FERC ¶ 61,224, at         P 83 (2012) (DATC Midwest) (finding that if DATC Midwest Holdings, LLC becomes a         transmission owning member of MISO, it would be entitled to receive the then-current         ROE that the Commission approved for MISO Transmission Owners); Ameren Services,         Co., 135 FERC ¶ 61,142, at P 94 (2011) (Ameren) (noting that the Commission has         approved a single base ROE for transmission-owning members of MISO, and protestors         have not demonstrated why applicants should not also be entitled to the same treatment if         such entities become transmission-owning members of MISO)).                 95                    Id. at 50.                 96                    TPZ Filing at 17.                 97                    Application at 51. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 25 -                                        ii.    Protests         49.     Several parties protest the use of the 12.38 percent MISO ROE for the New ITC         Operating Companies, arguing, among other things, that the MISO ROE is excessive,         based on outdated equity costs, and unsupported.98         50.     The Arkansas Commission and the Louisiana Commission argue that in the past         five years, capital costs in the United States have significantly decreased. The Arkansas         Commission explains that as a result, interest rates have decreased, representing a         decrease in interest rates of 186 to 250 basis points. The Arkansas Commission contends         that the cost of equity strongly correlates with interest rates, and that the cost of equity for         electric utilities has fallen such that reduced capital costs should be reflected in New ITC         Operating Companies’ proposed cost of equity. Additionally, the Arkansas Commission         states that the proposed ROE of 12.38 percent exceeds the 10.20 percent ROE that the         Arkansas Commission approved for Entergy Arkansas retail customers.99         51.     The Louisiana Commission and the Texas Commission argue that the current         MISO allowed return on common equity was last set in 2002, and should not be the basis         for setting rates going forward. The Louisiana Commission asserts that since the time         when the cost of common equity was determined for the MISO Transmission Owners, the         decline in capital costs ranges from approximately 280 to 340 basis points. The         Louisiana Commission cites expert testimony that a reasonable range of the current cost         of equity capital for fully-integrated electrics is between 8.50 percent and 9.50 percent,         which is more than 300 basis points below the return on equity requested by         Applicants.100         52.     The Texas Commission argues that the 12.38 percent ROE for Transmission         Owners within MISO is inflated, due to falling bond yields and lower expectation of                 98                    See, e.g., Arkansas Commission, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, Louisiana         Commission, Joint Customers, Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi, Texas         Commission, and the NRG Companies.                 99                    Arkansas Commission Mar. 22 Protest of TPZ Filing at 4, Docket No. ER13-         948-000.                 100                     Louisiana Commission Jan.22 Protest of Application at 12-13, Docket No.         ER12-2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                    - 26 -         ROE in the common equity markets as a whole since 2002.101 The Texas Commission         cites to a number of cases where parties filed complaints regarding excessive ROEs that         were lower than the 12.38 percent MISO ROE and the Commission set all of the ROE         issues for hearing.102 The Texas Commission argues that the Commission should require         Applicants to provide an ROE study, following the Commission’s Discounted Cash Flow         (DCF) methodology, that reflects current equity market conditions, and set this matter for         hearing and settlement judge procedures to set a reasonable ROE.103         53.     Joint Customers’ expert witness indicates that, by performing analysis that closely         tracks the analysis adopted when the 12.38 percent MISO ROE was originally         established, the just and reasonable base ROE for the Entergy transmission facilities is no         greater than 8.91 percent. Joint Customers also point to lower bond yields over a 10-year         period from August 2001 to December 2012, which they assert reflect a drop in the cost         of high-grade debt of between 316 and 372 basis points.104         54.     The Louisiana Commission further explains that electric utility transmission         operations are less technically complicated and therefore have a lower operation and         investment risk than fully-integrated utilities (i.e., utilities with generation). Joint         Customers agree, arguing that at the time that the Commission initially approved the         MISO ROE, MISO was a new RTO and there was great turmoil, uncertainty and risk for         RTOs in general and MISO in particular. The Louisiana Commission argues that if ITC         Holdings’ transmission operations have lower investment risk due to the nature of its         operations compared to fully-integrated electric utilities, and the current cost of equity         capital for fully-integrated electric utilities ranges from 8.50 percent to 9.50 percent, then         the cost of equity capital for the Applicants’ transmission operations should be below the                 101                     Texas Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 12, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.

Therefore, the Louisiana Commission asserts that the         risk to which common equity capital is exposed under a formula rate construct at the         Commission is substantially less than that which exists generally with publicly-traded         electric utilities, and the appropriate return for that risk is substantially lower.106 The         Louisiana Commission maintains that Commission precedent recognizes this outcome.107         55.     Joint Customers argue that another significant change since the MISO ROE was         established is the composition of the MISO proxy group. Joint Customers contend that         due to departures from MISO and other factors, only five of the nine companies in the         proxy group used to establish the 12.38 percent MISO ROE remain. Joint Customers         assert that this shift in proxy group eligibility is a further reason the 2002 DCF study that         underlies the 12.38 percent MISO ROE is not valid for establishing just and reasonable         rates for a new MISO Transmission Owner.108         56.     Joint Customers contend that Applicants’ request for a 12.38 percent ROE is         unsupported and contend that, while the Commission has permitted other Transmission         Owners that have entered MISO to adopt the same ROE, this approach has never been         reviewed or endorsed by the courts. Joint Customers argue that the Commission’s logic         creates a conclusive and irrebuttable presumption that an ROE deemed just and         reasonable for the companies that were MISO Transmission Owners in 2002 is also just         and reasonable as to any other company that becomes a MISO Transmission Owner.         Joint Customers assert that this presumption is premised on the view that MISO         participation is the only pertinent factor in determining a just and reasonable ROE of an         incoming utility. Joint Customers point out that the validity of this assumption has         never been established, generically or with respect to any particular incoming         Transmission Owner. Joint Customers argue that the absence of any confirmation that                 105                     Joint Customers make the same argument in their protest of the TPZ Filing.

Answer         57.     In response to protestors, Applicants argue that this FPA section 205 proceeding is         not the appropriate forum in which to challenge the MISO ROE because they have not         proposed to change it. Applicants state that changes to the MISO ROE require a separate         proceeding under FPA section 205 or 206. Applicants further contend that the New ITC         Operating Companies are entitled to use the 12.38 percent ROE in accordance with         Commission precedent because they will be Transmission Owner members of MISO.110         With regard to arguments that a DCF analysis reflecting current equity market conditions         is required in this proceeding to support the MISO ROE, Applicants state that the         Commission has, in previous decisions, rejected similar arguments.111                                      iv.     Response to Answer         58.     Joint Customers disagree with Applicants’ argument that DATC Midwest         demonstrates that a new Transmission Owner entering MISO is entitled to the MISO         ROE. Joint Customers contend that Applicants are not excused from demonstrating that         the ROE component of its operating subsidiaries’ rates and charges is just and reasonable         when it first submits the rates for filing under FPA section 205. Joint Customers further         maintain that even if the Commission authorized this ROE for some MISO Transmission         Owners, those orders do not have binding force of law in this proceeding.112         59.     Joint Customers also take issue with Applicants’ argument that this FPA         section 205 proceeding is not the place to challenge the MISO ROE, and that a separate         complaint under FPA section 206 is required. Joint Customers state that Applicants have         filed proposed formula rates and seek approval under FPA section 205 for the proposed                 109                     Id. at 58-60.                 110                     Applicants Feb. 22Answer at 9-10 (citing DATC Midwest, 139 FERC         ¶ 61,224, Docket No. ER12-2681-000).                 111                     Id. at 10-11.                 112                     Joint Customers Mar.11 Answer at 6-8, Docket No. ER12-2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                              - 29 -         ROE, and that the Commission must provide reasoning and evidence to support its         decision on the FPA section 205 filing, even in the absence of an FPA section 206         complaint challenging the current MISO ROE. Joint Customers point out that the         Commission can institute its own FPA section 206 investigation of the current MISO         ROE, but that the Commission cannot escape deciding the factual and legal issues created         by the FPA section 205 filing and the protests in this proceeding. Therefore, Joint         Customers contend that the Commission should reject Applicants’ proposed ROE and         order the use of the 8.91 percent ROE that Joint Customer’s witness demonstrated is just         and reasonable.113                                        v.    Commission Determination         60.      We accept the use of the MISO ROE for the Entergy Operating Companies and         the New ITC Operating Companies. The MISO ROE was established for all MISO         Transmission Owners.114 Accordingly, we find, consistent with Commission precedent,         that if the New ITC Operating Companies become members of MISO, they are entitled to         the then-current ROE that has been approved for use by all MISO Transmission Owners.         Similarly, we also find that the Entergy Operating Companies, if they become         Transmission Owners in MISO, are entitled, like all other MISO Transmission Owners,         to the then-current ROE.         61.      The Commission has previously approved a single base ROE for transmission-         owning members of MISO, and has found that “[t]ransmission-owning members of         MISO are currently authorized to use a 12.38 percent ROE for calculating their annual         transmission revenue requirement.”115 Although protestors have submitted an alternative         DCF analysis for the MISO Transmission Owners and other evidence to challenge the         MISO ROE, we find that protestors have not demonstrated why the New ITC Operating         Companies, or the Entergy Operating Companies, should not be entitled to the same         treatment as all other transmission-owning members of MISO.116                  113                      Id. at 8-9.                  114                      Midwest Indep.

We note protestors’ reliance on a number of recent cases, in which the         Commission has set the requested ROE for hearing. However, these cases are         distinguishable. In Martha Coakley and Grand Valley Rural, the challenges to the ROE         were made through FPA section 206 complaints.117 In contrast, the instant proceeding         involves applications under FPA section 205 to use the currently effective Commission-         approved MISO ROE in particular proposed Attachment O formula rates. As we note         above, if protestors wish to change the MISO ROE, they must file a separate FPA         section 206 complaint. Kansas City is also distinguishable. In that case, the applicant         proposed a new formula rate under FPA section 205, including an ROE, to establish its         transmission rates within SPP. Unlike the MISO Transmission Owners, the SPP         transmission owners have not established a generally applicable ROE for use by all of the         SPP transmission owners, and, therefore, individual SPP transmission owners must         propose and support an ROE for their own use when they file to change their rates. We         find that these cases are distinguishable from the facts in this proceeding.                               b.

Applicants argue that the Commission’s previous approval of the use of an         actual capital structure targeting 60 percent equity/40 percent debt for the Existing ITC         Operating Companies118 supports approval of a comparable capital structure for the New         ITC Operating Companies.119 Applicants state that the capital structure of the Existing         ITC Operating Companies has supported their ability to access capital markets to support         transmission investment even in times of extreme market volatility.120 Applicants         contend that the target capital structure results in a financial structure that properly         Indep.

Applicants further state         that less debt in the capital structures of the ITC Holdings’ operating subsidiaries         preserves investor confidence and allows for more predictable and cost effective access to         capital to support investment requirements.125                                       ii.     Protests         64.     The NRG Companies argue that Applicants have not supported the proposed         capital structure for the New ITC Operating Companies.126 Joint Customers state that         “[a]lthough ITC’s existing operating companies in MISO report capital structures that are         close to the requested target capital structure for [the New ITC Operating Companies],         the consolidated balance sheet of [ITC Holdings] has a capital structure that         (conservatively stated) is just 36 percent equity and 64 percent debt.”127 Joint Customers         add that “during the last four years (2008-2011), [ITC Holdings’] capital structure has         averaged 30 percent equity and 70 percent debt.”128 The Arkansas Commission also                 121                     Application at 52.                 122                     Id.                 123                     Id.                 124                     Id.                 125                     Application, Exhibit No. ITC-200: Bready Test. at 14.                 126                     NRG Companies Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 6, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 127                     Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 21, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 128                     Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 32 -         challenge the proposed capital structure, asserting that the New ITC Operating         Companies’ common equity is projected to be in the range of 42.5 percent to         48.8 percent, which is significantly less than the proposed capital structure of 60 percent         equity and 40 percent debt.129         65.     Joint Customers allege that the highly-leveraged capital structure at the holding-         company level and the 60 percent equity/40 percent debt capital structure at the operating         subsidiary level show that ITC Holdings has issued large sums of holding-company debt         and pushed this debt down to its operating subsidiaries as equity investment, enabling it         to earn an equity return on its holding-company level debt.130 Joint Customers explain         that the use of this practice is readily apparent from ITC Holdings’ balance sheet.131 Joint         Customers assert that it appears that a central purpose of the Entergy-ITC Transaction for         ITC Holdings is to extend its double leveraging practice to the former Entergy         transmission system.132 Joint Customers further state that the refinancing that is the         subject of the Section 204 Applications is specifically intended to provide long-term         financing that maintains the capital structure of the New ITC Operating Companies at the         requested 60 percent equity/40 percent debt.133         66.     Joint Customers argue that the 60 percent equity/40 percent debt capital structure         that Applicants represent as the basis for financing the New ITC Operating Companies is         extremely misleading.134 Joint Customers also argue that the ultimate stockholders in the         marketplace, those who own the public shares of ITC Holdings, see a vastly different         30 percent equity/70 percent debt (several year average) capital structure.135 According         to Joint Customers, ITC Holdings has been able to maintain solid investment grade credit         ratings despite this extremely low 30 percent equity ratio because the electric                 129                     Arkansas Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 2-3, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 130                     Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 21-22, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 131                     Id. at 22.                 132                     Id.                 133                     Id.                 134                     Id. at 23.                 135                     Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 33 -         transmission business is the lowest-risk business in the electric utility industry.136 Joint         Customers argue that the Commission largely eliminates the transmission business risk         by providing ITC Holdings’ operating companies with automatically adjusting annual         cost of service formula rates that guarantee the collection of all prudently incurred costs         of providing service through after-the-fact true-up provisions.137         67.     Joint Customers allege that, since ITC Holdings is simply a vehicle for         financing and owning the operating companies, the effect of its financing/ratemaking         construct is for ITC Holdings to borrow money at what it projects in this proceeding to be         3.5 percent; convert those borrowed funds into contributed common equity capital at the         operating company level by pushing the funds down to the operating companies; earn a         guaranteed formula-based equity return on those funds (in this case, the 12.38 percent         MISO ROE; pay the bondholders their 3.5 percent charge for having loaned the funds;         and provide the remaining 8.88 percent that was collected from ratepayers directly to the         stockholders of ITC Holdings.138 The Louisiana Commission adds that the proposed         hypothetical capital structure is unjust and unreasonable and does not reflect a reasonable         reflection of the capitalization of the project.139 The Louisiana Commission also argues         that the capital structure is not representative of how the assets of ITC Holdings are         actually capitalized.140 The Louisiana Commission states that the assets of ITC Holdings         are capitalized with far more debt capital than indicated in the requested ratemaking         capital structure.141         68.     Joint Customers state that they “do not find fault with [ITC Holdings’] financing         strategy” because “the extremely low risk of the Commission-regulated, cost-of-service         formula rate based transmission service can reasonably be financed with relatively low         equity levels.”142 However, Joint Customers argue that ITC Holdings attempt to         perpetuate a myth that its transmission businesses are financed with 60 percent equity,                 136                     Id.                 137                     Id.                 138                     Id.                 139                     Louisiana Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 11, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 140                     Id. at 18.                 141                     Id.                 142                     Id. at 24. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 34 -         when in fact, they are financed with approximately 30 percent equity, and that ITC         Holdings continues to seek to have ratepayers charged an equity return on borrowed         funds.143 Joint Customers argue that the Commission should require that the real sources         of the funds used to finance the rate bases of the operating companies and their actual         costs be used in the transmission formula rates of the operating companies.144 Joint         Customers argue that the most transparent way to so would be to use ITC Holdings’         capital structure and debt and equity cost rates rather than the fictitious capital structures         of the individual operating companies.145 The Louisiana Commission also asserts that the         highly leveraged nature of ITC Holdings has negative implications for ratepayers because         the parent company leverage substantially negates the debt cost savings that might         otherwise be available due to any lowered financial risk.146         69.     Joint Customers acknowledge that the Commission’s general practice is to use an         operating company’s actual capital structure (rather than the parent’s capital structure) if         the operating company issues its own debt without parent guarantees, has its own bond         rating, and has a capital structure within the range approved by the Commission.147         However, Joint Customers assert that there are ample grounds not to apply this approach         to the New ITC Operating Companies because the rates of transmission-only companies         are regulated exclusively by the Commission, and thus the Commission has freedom to         devise rate policies that avoid creating a perverse incentive for double leveraging.         They argue that the rates of the New ITC Operating Companies should be         established by imputing the consolidated capital structure of their corporate parent, using         the 60 percent/40 percent capital structure.148         70.     In addition, Joint Customers argue that the New ITC Operating Companies’         proposed capital structure results in a phantom income tax effect.

Joint Customers contend that the resulting income tax component of the         formula rate will be inflated because of the excessive ROE component of the cost of         capital due to the 60 percent equity ratio. They maintain that ITC Holdings will pay         income taxes on a consolidated holding company basis where its equity return will be         proportionately much less due to its much lower equity ratio, which has averaged only         30 percent.149                                      iii.   Answer         71.     In response to protestors, Applicants explain that the New ITC Operating         Companies’ proposed capital structure is consistent with Commission approval of similar         capital structures for ITC Holdings’ regulated subsidiaries in MISO and SPP, as well as         for other transmission-owning members of MISO.150 Applicants further explain that the         proposed capital structure has enabled ITC Holdings’ subsidiaries to access capital         markets to support transmission investment even in times of extreme market volatility.151         Applicants note that the proposed capital structure properly balances the risks faced by         ITC Holdings’ shareholders with the impact on the transmission rates of its subsidiaries’         customers.152 Applicants further note that a formula rate that utilizes solely debt         financing would put undue risk on ITC Holdings’ shareholders. They argue that,         conversely, a formula rate that utilizes only equity financing would unfairly burden         transmission customers by inflating the overall weighted average cost of capital.153         72.     Applicants also explain that, because the New ITC Operating Companies will be         independent transmission companies dedicated exclusively to constructing, owning,                 149                     Id. at 25-26.                 150                     Applicants Feb. 22 Answer at 11 (citing Application, Exhibit No. ITC-200:         Bready Test. at 13-14 (citing Atlantic Grid Operations A LLC, 135 FERC ¶ 61,144         (2011); Tallgrass Transmission, LLC, 132 FERC ¶ 61,114 (2010); Startrans IO, L.L.C.,         122 FERC ¶ 61,306 (2008); Transource Missouri, LLC, 141 FERC ¶ 61,075 (2012),         Docket No. ER12-2681-000)).                 151                     Id. at 12.                 152                     Id.                 153                     Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 36 -         operating, and maintaining transmission infrastructure, they will be unable to diversify         their business and thus will have no other revenue-generating activities.154 For this         reason, Applicants assert that a capital structure targeting 40 percent debt is appropriate         because the New ITC Operating Companies will be less able to withstand disruptions in         their revenue streams compared to companies with varied revenue sources.155         73.     Further, Applicants respond that a capital structure of 60 percent equity/40 percent         debt leads to lower fixed interest payments.156 Applicants further argue that a debt level         of 40 percent in the capital structures of the New ITC Operating Companies will preserve         investor confidence and allow for more predictable and cost-effective access to capital to         support significant and sustained levels of investment requirements.157         74.     Applicants state that the proposed capital structure, coupled with the 12.38 percent         MISO ROE and a forward-looking formula rate, will mitigate the risks faced by the New         ITC Operating Companies, will provide the companies with steady and predictable cash         flows, and will support their strong credit quality, which also will protect the interests of         transmission customers.158 Applicants also state that this rate construct (capital structure,         ROE, and forward-looking formula rate) has enabled the other ITC Holdings operating         subsidiaries to raise the capital necessary for substantial investment in transmission.159         75.     In response to the Louisiana Commission’s argument that the proposed capital         structure is hypothetical, Applicants contend that they are not proposing a hypothetical         capital structure.160 Rather, Applicants propose that the New ITC Operating Companies         use an actual capital structure targeting 60 percent equity/40 percent debt, calculated on         an annual 13-month average basis.161                 154                     Id.                 155                     Id.                 156                     Id.                 157                     Id.                 158                     Id. at 12-13.                 159                     Id. 13 (citing Application, Exhibit No. ITC-200: Bready Test. at 11-16).                 160                     Id. at 13.                 161                     Id. at 13 (citing Opinion No. 414-A, 84 FERC ¶ 61,084; ITC Holdings.

Applicants also maintain that under well-established precedent, the Commission         should disregard protestors’ assertions regarding double leveraging.162 Applicants         explain that the Commission uses a utility’s own capital structure “if the utility issues its         own debt without guarantees, has its own bond rating, and has a capital structure within         the range of capital structures approved by the Commission.”163 Applicants assert that         the Commission will only look to the parent’s capital structure if these conditions are not         met.164 Applicants explain that the New ITC Operating Companies have demonstrated         that each of these conditions is satisfied. Applicants state that each of the New ITC         Operating Companies has filed for authorization to issue its own debt under section 204         of the FPA.165 And that there will be no parent guarantees of debt issued by the New ITC         Operating Companies.166 Further, Applicants state that the Section 204 Applications         explain that each of the New ITC Operating Companies will have their own bond         ratings.167 Applicants state that the request for use of an actual capital structure targeting         60 percent equity and 40 percent debt is fully within the range of capital structures         approved by the Commission, and consistent with the Commission’s approval of the use         of an actual capital structure targeting 60 percent equity/40 percent debt for the Existing         ITC Operating Companies.168         ¶ 61,182, at P 68 (2003); Green Power Express, LP, 127 FERC ¶ 61,031, at P 72 (2009),         order on reh’g, 135 FERC ¶ 61,141 (2011)).                162                    Id. at 13.                163                    Id. at 13-14 (citing ITC Midwest, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229 at P 49).                164                    Id. at 14.                165                    Id.                166                    Id.                167                    Id. at 14 (citing ITC Arkansas LLC, et al.

Lastly, Applicants dispute that there is any “phantom tax effect” resulting from the         proposed capital structure.169 They state that each of the New ITC Operating Companies         will be responsible for its share of income taxes as part of ITC Holdings’ consolidated tax         return.170 Applicants argue that the recovery of income taxes by the New ITC Operating         Companies is entirely consistent with Commission policy.171                                        iv.    Commission Determination         78.     We find the capital structure proposed by Applicants for the New ITC Operating         Companies to be just and reasonable and consistent with Commission policy. As the         parties to this proceeding recognize in their pleadings, in approving the capital structure         to be used for ratemaking, the Commission has used the operating company’s actual         capital structure where the operating company: (1) issues its own debt without         guarantees; (2) has its own bond rating; and (3) has a capital structure within the range of         capital structures approved by the Commission.172 This three-part test demonstrates         separation of financial risks between operating and parent company. In this situation, use         of the operating company’s market driven capital structure more accurately reflects the         utility’s operational and financial risk than that of the holding company.173 We find that         the New ITC Operating Companies meet this three-part test, as have other ITC Holdings         subsidiaries.174 Therefore, we find that the proposal to use the actual capital structures of                 169                     Id. at 15.                 170                     Id.                 171                     Id.(citing Inquiry Regarding Income Tax Allowances, Policy Statement on         Income Tax Allowances, 111 FERC ¶ 61,139, order dismissing reh’g request, 112 FERC         ¶ 61,203 (2005)).                 172                     See, e.g., ITC Midwest, LLC, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229; Opinion No. 414-A, 84         FERC ¶ 61,084 at 61,413-15.                 173                     Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., Opinion No. 414, 80 FERC ¶ 61,157,         at 61,664 (1997) (quoting Kentucky West Virginia Gas Company, 2 FERC ¶ 61,139, at         61,325 (1978) (“In our opinion a utility should be regulated on the basis of its being an         independent entity; that is, a utility should be considered as nearly as possible on its own         merits and not on those of its affiliates.”)).                 174                     See ITC Midwest, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229 at P 49.

Protestors have not presented evidence or provided any basis to depart from our         policy that the regulated utility’s actual capital structure is used in establishing the overall         rate of return so long as it meets the three-part test outlined above. Further, the         Commission has addressed similar double leveraging arguments and found that the rate         of return should not depend on who owns the facility, nor on how that owner, whether a         holding company or individual stockholders, financed its investment.176 Also, we find         that the Louisiana Commission’s arguments that the highly leveraged nature of ITC         Holdings may negate the debt cost savings are unsubstantiated. We find that the         proposed capital structure is just and reasonable, as explained above, and has been shown         to contribute to achieving and maintaining credit ratings and accessing capital markets.177         80.     Lastly, we disagree with Joint Customers’ arguments regarding an alleged         phantom tax effect. The Commission has a policy for determining tax allowances on a         stand-alone operating company basis.178 Under our income tax policy, public utilities are         entitled to receive an income tax allowance when they pass-through profits to their parent         and the parent incurs an actual or potential income tax liability on the distributive income         received. It is therefore appropriate to provide the New ITC Operating Companies with         an income tax allowance because ITC Holdings will incur an income tax liability on the         distributive income received from its subsidiaries.                 175                     The Commission notes that it previously approved actual capital structures         targeting 60 percent equity and 40 percent for other ITC Holdings’ operating companies.         See, e.g., ITC Holdings Corp., 102 FERC ¶ 61,182 (2003) (approving requested capital         structure for ITCTransmission), ITC Holdings Corp., 121 FERC ¶ 61,229 (2007)         (approving requested capital structure for ITC Midwest LLC).                 176                     Williams Natural Gas Co., 80 FERC ¶ 61,158, at 61,682 (1997), order on         reh’g, 86 FERC¶ 61,232, at 61,858-59 (1999).

Forward Looking Formula Rate                                       i.     Proposal         81.     Applicants seek approval to use a forward-looking Attachment O formula rate         template with a true-up mechanism, similar to the forward-looking implementation of         Attachment O that the Commission approved for the Existing ITC Operating Companies,         as well as for American Transmission Company.179 Applicants explain how the use of a         forward looking test year, rather than a historical test year, eliminates recovery lag by         better matching cost incurrence and cost collection.180 Applicants explain that the         forward looking formula rate is coupled with an annual true-up adjustment, calculated         after the close of each rate year, which protects both customers and ITC Holdings by         accounting for the difference between forecasted and actual results. 181 According to         Applicants, any difference, including interest, is then incorporated in subsequent years.182         Applicants contend that the true-up ensures that customers are not harmed if the actual         revenue requirement is less than the forecast.183 Conversely, Applicants assert that the         true-up also protects ITC Holdings if the actual revenue requirement is more than the         forecast.184 Applicants explain that the formula rate and true-up operate to ensure that the         New ITC Operating Companies recover only their revenue requirements.185         82.     Applicants further explain the implementation of the New ITC Operating         Companies MISO Attachment O formula rate.186 Applicants state that between the close         of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, which, at the time of the filing of the Application, was                 179                     Application at 52 (citing American Transmission Co.

Applicants state that the resulting rate will be         charged by the New ITC Operating Companies between closing of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction and January 1, 2014. Applicants state that any differences between revenues         billed under the Entergy Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates and         those that would have been billed under the New ITC Operating Companies MISO         Attachment O formula rate will be trued-up in 2014 and collected in the New ITC         Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates beginning on January 1,         2015.188         83.    Additionally, Applicants explain how the true-up mechanism will operate.189         Applicants explain that if the amounts collected by the New ITC Operating Companies         exceed the amounts necessary to recover their actual revenue requirement, as calculated         when actual FERC Form No. 1 data becomes available, the New ITC Operating         Companies will refund any such amounts to their customers (with interest at the rate         prescribed by the Commission’s regulations) in their rates effective the following year.190         Similarly, Applicants state that if the amounts collected by the New ITC Operating         Companies are less than their actual revenue requirement, the companies would collect         any such under recovery from customers (with interest capped at the New ITC Operating         Companies’ short term borrowing rates) in rates effective the following year.191         Applicants state that there is a deliberate asymmetry designed into the interest rate                187                    Application at 53.                188                    Id.                189                    Id. at 54.

Protests         84.      The Texas Commission argues that it is necessary to proceed in a cautious fashion         that balances the need to provide rate recovery assurances to Applicants on the one hand         without jeopardizing customer protections on the other hand. The Texas Commission         asserts that instead of approving an untested and unpopulated forward-looking formula         rate, the Commission should direct Applicants to first use the existing MISO Attachment         O formula rate. The Texas Commission asserts that, after the Entergy-ITC Transaction         closes, Applicants could come back to the Commission with a comprehensive and         complete application for authorization to move to a forward-looking transmission rate         formula.193         85.      The City of New Orleans states that Applicants’ formula rate true-up mechanism         requires additional explanation.194 The City of New Orleans states that the true-up will         preclude under- or over-recovery of its revenue requirements.195 The City of New         Orleans states that, according to Applicants, the proposed true-up compares the revenue         “actually collected” to the results of the formula rate populated with actual annual data.196         The City of New Orleans states that it is not clear from the Application how ITC         Holdings determines the actual revenue collected.197 The City of New Orleans states that         if the true-up compares forecasted revenue requirements to actual revenue requirements         determined based on FERC Form No. 1-filed data after the year ends, as Applicants         suggest, then the true-up does not determine actual revenue collected, which could vary                  192                      Id.                  193                      Texas Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 11-12, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                  194                      City of New Orleans Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 17, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                  195                      Id.                  196                      Id.                  197                      Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 43 -         depending on, among other things, whether the billing determinants are accurate         compared to demand.198                                        iii.   Answer         86.     Applicants explain that forward-looking formula rates are widely used within         MISO and have been approved for the Existing ITC Operating Companies.200                199         Applicants assert that the protests offer no substantive arguments for why a forward-         looking application of the Attachment O formula rate should not be implemented at the         outset by the New ITC Operating Companies, as it was for ITC Midwest.201 Applicants         further assert that nothing would be gained by requiring that the New ITC Operating         Companies make the same filing again in the future.202         87.     In response to the City of New Orleans’ concerns about forecasted revenues,         Applicants state that, as explained in the Wrenbeck Testimony, the true up calculation         compares actual revenues received to the actual revenue requirement. 203 Applicants         further state that actual revenue received is the transmission service revenue received         from MISO.204 According to Applicants, these revenues are determined when MISO         charges the New ITC Operating Companies’ forecasted network rate to the load in the         New ITC Operating Companies’ transmission pricing zones; the New ITC Operating         Companies will receive the revenue from these charges.205 Applicants note that those         revenues are then compared to the actual revenue requirement calculated using actual         data from the FERC Form No. 1, with any resulting over-collection or under collection         reflected in the true up adjustment.206 Applicants argue that ITC Holdings, however,                 198                     Id.                 199                     Applicants Feb. 22 Answer at 21, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 200                     Id.

Response         88.     In its response, the City of New Orleans states that Applicants’ additional         explanation regarding the proposed true-up calculation used in the proposed formula rate         satisfies its concerns if the commitments are memorialized in an order.208                                        v.    Commission Determination         89.     We accept Applicants’ proposed use of a forward-looking rate for the New ITC         Operating Companies. The Commission has approved similar forward-looking formula         rates for other MISO Transmission Owners.209 The use of a forward-looking formula         rate, along with the true-up mechanism, ensures that customers will ultimately only pay         the cost of service they would have paid on a lagging basis.210 Forward-looking formula         rates, if properly designed and supported, as is the case here, are acceptable to avoid lag         in cost recovery.211                                 d.

Applicants explain that the proposed formula rate protocols have been carefully         crafted to ensure transparency and open communication with regulators, customers, and         all interested parties regarding the annual rate projection and true-up calculations.212                 207                     Id.                 208                     City of New Orleans Mar. 11 Response at n.7, 10-11, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 209                     See, e.g., Midwest Indep.

Applicants state that the proposed formula rate protocols establish the dates by         which the forward-looking rate and True-up Adjustment will be posted on MISO’s         OASIS and made available to regulators and stakeholders.215 Further, the proposed         formula rate protocols set forth a formal process through which the formula rate         projection and cost details will be explained to regulators, customers, and stakeholders.216         Applicants explain that the proposed formula rate protocols promote transparency and         broad participation by requiring that rate information be provided to regulators and         stakeholders.217 Applicants add that the outcome of the proceeding in Docket         No. EL12-35-000 (MISO Protocols Investigation) will inform the Commission’s review         of the proposed formula rate protocols proposed here.218 Applicants state that they agree         to modify the proposed formula rate protocols as may be necessary to comply with the         Commission’s directives in the MISO Protocols Investigation.219                213                     Id. at 59 (citing ITC Midwest, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229; Michigan Electric         Transmission Co., LLC, 119 FERC ¶ 61,203 (2007)).

Protests         92.     Several parties protest the proposed formula rate protocols. Joint Customers argue         that the formula rate protocols proposed for the New ITC Operating Companies are not         just and reasonable and should be rejected by the Commission.220 Southwestern requests         that the Commission apply whatever final determinations it makes to the MISO formula         rate protocols in the MISO Protocols Investigation to the formula rate protocols that         Applicants propose in this proceeding.221 Similarly, the Arkansas Commission requests         certain changes to make the proposed formula rate protocols more transparent.         93.     Joint Customers state, in response to the statement of Applicants agreeing to         modify the proposed formula rate protocols to reflect the outcome of the MISO Protocols         Investigation, that an offer to conform the formula rate protocols to the outcome of the         MISO Protocols Investigation is insufficient.222 Joint Customers assert that the         Commission cannot base its decision on a moving target.223         94.     Furthermore, the Joint Customers argue that, even if the Commission does make         changes generically to the pro forma MISO Attachment O formula rate protocols, the         New ITC Operating Companies are in a different situation. Joint Customers argue that,         because the Entergy-ITC Transaction represents a change for Entergy transmission         customers, there is a need for greater transparency here than for the existing MISO         transmission-owning members.224         95.     Generally, Joint Customers argue that the Applicants’ proposed formula rate         protocols: (1) lack an informational filing requirement;225 (2) fail to provide for                 220                     Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 70, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 221                     Southwestern Electric Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 8, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 222                     Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 71, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 223                     Id.                 224                     Id. Joint Customers assert that the Entergy protocols are superior to ITC         Holdings’ protocols because the Entergy protocols provide for an informational filing and         discovery and challenge rights.                 225                     Id. at 73. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 47 -         discovery rights;226 (3) lack adequate challenge procedures; 227 and (4) lack other         customer protections.228         96.     Similarly, the Arkansas Commission raises three issues with the proposed formula         rate protocols. First, that more time must be afforded for retail regulators, customers, and         stakeholders to review the forward-looking transmission rates.229 Second, that each of         the New ITC Operating Companies should also provide sufficiently-detailed information         in their informational filings on August 1, to enable retail regulators, transmission service         customers and other stakeholders to understand the basis for the annual update to the         rates for transmission service.230 Third, that there should be sufficient time and         opportunity to allow for several rounds of discovery by retail regulators, customers and         other stakeholders regarding the annual updated rates and charges for transmission         service, if needed.231                                      iii.   Answer         97.     Applicants respond to protestors that the New ITC Operating Companies propose         to follow practices comparable to or enhanced beyond those previously approved by the         Commission for similarly-situated, independent transmission companies using forward         looking formula rates.232 Applicants state that the Commission has recognized that the         proposed formula rate protocols of two ITC Holdings’ operating companies in MISO,         ITC Midwest and Michigan Electric Transmission, go beyond the MISO formula rate         protocols and specifically allow state commission access to information concerning these         companies’ net projected revenue requirements.233 Applicants state that the proposed         formula rate protocols proposed for the New ITC Operating Companies include these                 226                     Id. at 75.                 227                     Id. at 76.                 228                     Id. at 78.                 229                     Arkansas Commission Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 4, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 230                     Id.                 231                     Id. at 5-6.                 232                     Applicants Feb. 22 Answer at 22, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 233                     Id. at 23. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 48 -         provisions and others beyond those in the existing MISO formula rate protocols.         Applicants reiterate that, should the Commission find the proposed formula rate protocols         to be inadequate, the New ITC Operating Companies have committed to use whatever         proposed formula rate protocols the Commission directs in the MISO Protocols         Investigation.234                                       iv.    Response         98.     In their response to Applicants, Joint Customers reiterate their argument that         Applicants are in a different situation than other Transmission Owners in MISO.235 They         note that the formula rate protocols proposed for the New ITC Operating Companies are         not already filed rate schedules.236 Joint Customers emphasize that the proposed formula         rate protocols lack any discovery rights and adequate challenge procedures, both of         which are critical components of just and reasonable formula rate protocols.237 Joint         Customers argue that a commitment to modify, possibly, the proposed formula rate         protocols at some point in the future does not change the fact that what was filed is unjust         and unreasonable.238                                       v.     Commission Determination         99.     We accept the ITC Applicants’ and the Entergy Operating Companies’ respective         formula rate protocols, subject to modification to comply with the Commission’s recently         issued order in the MISO Protocols Investigation.239 We recognize Joint Customers’ and         retail regulators’ concerns regarding their participation in the New ITC Operating         Companies’ transmission rate development process. However, we find that their         concerns are adequately addressed by the MISO Protocols Investigation Order, as         discussed below.                 234                     Id.                 235                     Joint Customers Mar. 11 Answer at 24, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 236                     Id.                 237                     Id.                 238                     Id.                 239                     Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys. Operator, Inc., 143 FERC ¶ 61,149 (2013)         (MISO Protocols Investigation Order). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 49 -         100. In the MISO Protocols Investigation, the Commission found that the existing         MISO Attachment O formula rate protocols were insufficient to ensure just and         reasonable rates and, therefore, directed the MISO Transmission Owners to file revised         formula rate protocols to address the inadequacies of the protocols. Many of the         concerns raised in that proceeding align with the concerns raised by Joint Customers and         retail regulators in this proceeding.         101. For example, with respect to participation, the Commission found that the MISO         Attachment O formula rate protocols inappropriately limited the ability of certain         interested parties to obtain information and participate in review processes and were,         thus, unjust and unreasonable.240 The Commission directed MISO and the Transmission         Owners to revise the protocols to include all interested parties in information exchange         and review processes.241         102. With respect to transparency, the Commission found that MISO’s Attachment O         formula rate protocols fail to provide sufficient information with respect to MISO         Transmission Owners’ costs and revenue requirements.242 The Commission found that         MISO’s protocols for both historical and forward-looking formula rates must require         Transmission Owners to post their revenue requirements, and relevant information, on         both MISO’s website and OASIS, and then hold an annual meeting open to all interested         parties, where the Transmission Owners can explain and those parties can review and         discuss the Transmission Owners’ calculations.243 The Commission further required that         MISO specify in its protocols an adequate time period for interested parties to review         information following its posting on MISO’s website and OASIS.244 The Commission         also found that MISO must also include a requirement that the Transmission Owner make         a good faith effort to respond to information requests within a set, reasonable period of         time.245 The Commission required that MISO’s formula rate protocols include a                 240                     Id. P 31.                 241                     Id.                 242                     Id. P 78.                 243                     Id. P 83.                 244                     Id.

Further, with respect to challenge procedures, the Commission found MISO’s         challenge procedures were insufficient and required interested parties to traverse an ad         hoc system of procedures to raise issues with Transmission Owners’ annual updates.247         The Commission found that the absence of structured informal and formal challenge         procedures in the MISO Attachment O formula rate protocols renders the protocols unjust         and unreasonable.248 The Commission found that interested parties must be afforded the         ability to challenge a Transmission Owners’ annual update and resolve related disputes         through straightforward and defined procedures.249         104. Accordingly, we direct the ITC Applicants and the Entergy Operating Companies         to file, within 60 days of the date of this order, formula rate protocols that comply with         the MISO Protocols Investigation Order. We note that parties will be provided the         opportunity to respond to this filing once it is submitted to the Commission.                                 e.    Transmission Pricing Zones Proposal                                       i.     Proposal         105. The Entergy Operating Companies propose to establish four transmission pricing         zones for the Entergy footprint within MISO – one for Entergy Texas; one for Entergy         Gulf States, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans; one for Entergy Arkansas; and         one for Entergy Mississippi.250 The Entergy Operating Companies state that these         four transmission pricing zones will be among the largest zones in MISO. The Entergy         Operating Companies explain that the Arkansas and Mississippi Commissions have made         separate Arkansas and Mississippi transmission pricing zones conditions to allowing         Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi, respectively, to transfer functional control of         their transmission facilities to MISO. The Entergy Operating Companies also note that                  246                      Id. P 89.                  247                      Id. P 111.                  248                      Id.

Application at 25. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 51 -         the City of New Orleans has expressed its view that “it will be in the best interest of         New Orleans Council-jurisdiction ratepayers for [Entergy New Orleans] to have its own         transmission pricing zone.”251 The Entergy Operating Companies note that it will amend         the TPZ Filing if discussions between the City of New Orleans, Entergy New Orleans,         Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States, and the Louisiana Commission result in an         agreement regarding Entergy New Orleans having its own transmission pricing zone.                                       ii.    Protests         106. Joint Customers argue that, given that Entergy has had a single regional         transmission rate structure since the early 1990s, Entergy has not justified its proposal to         replace a single energy transmission rate with four Entergy Operating Company zonal         rates. Joint Customers assert that, not only does a single rate reflect Entergy’s historical         treatment, but entities within the Entergy region have relied on this rate, and Entergy has         proposed no change in operations to justify this change. Additionally, Joint Customers         argue that zonal pricing is “antithetical to the regional nature” of the Entergy system,         single-zone pricing is consistent with Commission precedent, and multiple zone pricing is         inconsistent with Entergy’s proposed treatment of storm cost recovery securitization         expenses.252         107. With respect to the storm cost recovery securitization expenses, Joint Customers         state that the Entergy Operating Companies propose to add these securitization costs to         the formula rate templates and to have MISO collect a surcharge to continue         securitization cost recovery from wholesale customers. Joint Customers contend,         however, that the Entergy Operating Companies have failed to explain how the proposal         divides the securitization costs among the Entergy Operating Companies. Further, Joint         Customers assert state that Schedule 41, as proposed in the Application, appears to         contemplate that all wholesale customers in the Midsouth transmission system253 will be         charged unit cost or load ratio share of all of the securitization costs previously accepted                 251                     TPZ Filing at 19.                 252                     Joint Customers Mar. 22 Protest of TPZ Filing at 35-39, Docket No. ER13-         948-000. Specifically, Joint Customers are concerned that the proposal to use four         pricing zones is inconsistent with Commission-approved settlement agreements that         establish how the securitized storm costs will be recovered across the Entergy         transmission system.                 253                     Midsouth refers to the area of MISO that will be served by the Entergy         transmission facilities. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 52 -         by the Commission.254 Joint Customers complain that the proposed treatment of         securitization costs makes no effort to match ongoing responsibility for securitization         costs with the benefits of the associated plant, as customers in any of the four pricing         zones may be subject to the securitization costs surcharge in amounts that exceed the         portion of the plant funded by securitization bonds attributed to that zone.255         108. Joint Customers also point to the requirement in Order No. 888 for holding         company systems, such as Entergy, to provide transmission service under a single-system         wide tariff across the entire holding company system at a single, system-wide         transmission rate.256 They argue that, consistent with Order No. 888, the Commission, in         a case involving PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM), has previously rejected a proposal to         create separately priced zones for each of a holding company’s operating companies         under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff.257 Joint Customers rely on the         Commission’s determination that the participation of the utility’s operating companies in         PJM did not justify separate zonal rates, and the Commission’s reaffirmation that long-         affiliated and centrally planned entities must use a single system-wide rate. 258 Joint                 254                     Entergy originally proposed rate revisions in Docket Nos.

Like Joint Customers, Lafayette Utilities and LEPA also argue that the         Commission should prohibit the division of the Entergy transmission system into four         state-based zones because the wholesale customers that use the Entergy transmission         system have supported and paid for that system for decades.260 Lafayette Utilities and         LEPA point out similarities between the previous Entergy proposal in which it proposed         a tariff for each operating company with a separate rate for each zone and the TPZ         Filing.261 According to Lafayette Utilities and LEPA, the Commission rejected that         proposal, stating that Entergy operated its system on an integrated basis and made sales at         market-based rates on a system basis.262 Lafayette Utilities and LEPA state that the         Commission noted that Entergy had a pool agreement that recognized that the         transmission system is planned and operated on a single system basis and equalizes the         transmission cost per kW to reflect this fact. Lafayette Utilities and LEPA explain that,         based on these findings, the Commission found no reason to require customers to         negotiate separately with up to four different operating companies or to pay different         transmission charges based on the particular Entergy company designated by Entergy as         the contract path. As Lafayette Utilities and LEPA observe, the Commission directed         Entergy to consolidate its tariffs into one and to adopt a single rate reflecting equalized         costs under its pool agreement.263                 259                     Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of TPZ Filing at 42-43, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                 260                     Lafayette Utilities and LEPA Protest of TPZ Filing at 8-14, Docket No. ER13-         948-000.                 261                     The four transmission pricing zones proposed by the Entergy Operating         Companies in the TPZ Filing are based on state boundaries rather than operating         company service area.                 262                     Entergy Services, Inc., 58 FERC ¶ 61,234, at 61,772, order on reh’g, 60 FERC         ¶ 61,168 (1992), rev’d and remanded on other grounds, Cajun Electric Power         Cooperative, Inc. v.

Additionally, Lafayette Utilities and LEPA maintain that, even though the TPZ         Filing proposes state-based zones rather than operating company zones, the Commission         has not favored state-based zones either. As an example, they cite the Commission’s         rejection of Southern Company’s (Southern) proposal to divide its transmission system         into an eastern pricing zone (comprised of Georgia Power and Savannah Electric) and a         western pricing zone (comprised of Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi         Power).264 In that case, the Commission found Southern’s proposal deficient, stating that,         among other things, Southern did “not explain why a geographic zone should reflect         political or corporate subdivisions rather than electrical characteristics (e.g., data showing         that power flows in one zone do not affect flows in the other zone).” 265         111. In its protest, the City of New Orleans asks the Commission “to direct Entergy to         implement an [Entergy New Orleans]-specific [transmission pricing zone] with a license         plate rate irrespective of whether [Entergy New Orleans] joins MISO as a Transmission         Owner or [ITC Holdings] owns the [Entergy New Orleans] transmission assets when         Entergy integrates with MISO.”266 The City of New Orleans argues that an Entergy         New Orleans-only zone is consistent with the Commission’s precedent on license plate         pricing and RTO practice. The City of New Orleans also asserts that Entergy has offered         no justification to support different transmission pricing zone configurations dependent         upon who owns the Entergy transmission system. The City of New Orleans argues that         Entergy’s proposal is unduly discriminatory to Entergy New Orleans, and emphasizes its         commitment to secure a separate transmission pricing zone for Entergy New Orleans.         The City of New Orleans maintains that Entergy’s failure to propose a separate         transmission pricing zone for Entergy New Orleans places the Entergy-ITC Transaction         at risk, as the City of New Orleans has the ability to grant or decline to approve the         transfer of Entergy New Orleans’ transmission assets to a third party.267                 264                     Southern Co.

The Louisiana Commission states that the transmission pricing zone issues and         others are subject to approval by the Louisiana Commission.268 The Louisiana         Commission also states that, at this time, it does not support a separate pricing zone for         Entergy New Orleans.269                                       iii.   Answers         113. In their response to protestors, the Entergy Operating Companies maintain that the         use of separate transmission pricing zones is consistent with MISO’s and PJM’s         structures, and that other similarly situated MISO transmission-owning members with         multiple operating companies under a holding company structure have established         transmission pricing zones by state. The Entergy Operating Companies contend that         customers will benefit from the Entergy Operating Companies’ move to MISO due to the         elimination of rate pancaking between MISO and the Entergy Operating Companies.270         The Entergy Operating Companies also assert that historical treatment under the Entergy         OATT has no bearing on transmission pricing zones under MISO Attachment O. In         response to Joint Customers and Lafayette Utilities and LEPA, the Entergy Operating         Companies point out that one of the proposed company-specific amendments to the         MISO Attachment O formula rate templates includes language to honor existing         settlement agreements to ensure that wholesale transmission customers will bear their         share of the storm restoration costs.271 The Entergy Operating Companies and MISO also         clarify that securitization costs will be recovered in the zone where the storm costs         occurred.272 Additionally, the Entergy Operating Companies explain that, during the         annual MISO Attachment O rate update process, Entergy Services will prepare a work         paper showing the amount of the storm securitization charged by each affected Entergy         Operating Company.273                 268                     Louisiana Commission Mar. 22 Protest of TPZ Filing at 2, Docket No. ER13-         948-000.                 269                     Id. at 5.                 270                     Entergy Operating Companies Apr. 9 Answer at 14, Docket No. ER13-948-         000.                 271                     Id. at 16.                 272                     Id.                 273                     Id. at n.13. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 56 -         114. The Entergy Operating Companies reiterate that they do not oppose a separate         Entergy New Orleans pricing zone and that Entergy New Orleans and Entergy Louisiana         commit to continue to facilitate discussions among themselves, the City of New Orleans,         Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and the Louisiana Commission about the issue.274         115. The City of New Orleans argues that there is no rationale for system-wide pricing         across the Entergy transmission system after Entergy joins MISO. According to the City         of New Orleans, protestors ignore the significantly changed circumstances that MISO         membership brings, particularly a uniform process for recovering an operating         company’s annual transmission revenue requirement based on the operating company         specific license plate rates.275 The City of New Orleans states that the protestors’         proposals to establish an Entergy transmission pricing zone conflicts with the         Commission-approved practice of using utility-specific transmission pricing zones with         license plate rates in MISO and the majority of other RTOs.276 The City of New Orleans         argues that multiple transmission pricing zones, including an Entergy New Orleans         transmission pricing zone, will not violate storm recovery settlements or negatively         impact future disaster mitigation because there is no apparent connection between how         the transmission pricing zones are designed and the mitigation of the costs of natural         disasters for customers.277         116. The Arkansas Commission also argues that the Commission should approve the         proposed four transmission pricing zones for the Entergy Operating Companies. The         Arkansas Commission states that, notwithstanding the Commission’s authority over the         Entergy-ITC Transaction under FPA section 203, the Commission should recognize the         authority of state regulators to consider the impacts of such proposed transactions. The         Arkansas Commission notes that, in its approval of Entergy Arkansas becoming a         member of MISO, the Arkansas Commission required that Entergy Arkansas have a         separate transmission pricing zone. The Arkansas Commission states that Entergy         Arkansas agreed to this condition, subject to acceptance by MISO and the Commission.         The Arkansas Commission states that ITC Holdings also committed to maintain a         separate transmission pricing zone for Entergy Arkansas if the Commission were to         accept Entergy’s proposal to create an Entergy Arkansas transmission pricing zone. The         Arkansas Commission argues that the Commission should not ignore the conditions                 274                     Id. at 17.                 275                     City of New Orleans Apr. 8 Response at 3-5, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 276                     Id. at 5-7.                 277                     Id. at 12. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 57 -         imposed by state regulators. The Arkansas Commission asserts that the Commission         should not upset the conditions and commitments established in Entergy Arkansas’s         proceeding before the Arkansas Commission regarding that company’s integration into         MISO, particularly where the conditions imposed will not have an adverse impact on         rates, regulation, or competition as contemplated by FPA section 203.278         117. The Arkansas Commission states that the Commission should reject the arguments         of Lafayette Utilities and LEPA, and Joint Customers opposing Entergy’s transmission         pricing zone proposal. The Arkansas Commission states that the historic operations of         the Entergy transmission system do not preclude the creation of separate transmission         pricing zones at this time. The Arkansas Commission argues that given the changed         circumstances of the Entergy transmission system, including the withdrawal of Entergy         Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi from the Entergy System Agreement, it is appropriate         to revisit the scope of transmission pricing zones. The Arkansas Commission notes that         the Commission has approved separate pricing zones for affiliated operating companies         in MISO, PJM, and the New York Independent System Operator, Inc.279         118. The City of New Orleans also responds to the protests of Lafayette Utilities and         LEPA, and Joint Customers to the Application, and argue in support of the transmission         pricing zones proposal in the TPZ Filing.280 The City of New Orleans counters Lafayette         Utilities and LEPA’s arguments regarding the Commission’s rejection of Entergy’s         previous proposal to create transmission pricing zones, pointing out that the order pre-         dates Commission orders approving utility specific license plate rates in MISO and PJM.         The City of New Orleans asserts that service across the entire MISO system is provided         under a single MISO Tariff, and that requests for interconnection and determinations         regarding whether a related system upgrade is required to accommodate a new         interconnection occur under a single MISO Tariff. Therefore, the City of New Orleans         contends that the Commission’s concerns in the previous Entergy case do not exist in a                 278                     Arkansas Commission Apr. 8 Answer at 6-8, Docket Nos.

ER13-948-000 and ER12-2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 58 -         regional transmission organization.281 Likewise, the City of New Orleans argues that the         Commission’s order rejecting Southern’s proposal for two transmission pricing zones is         outdated and that although Lafayette Utilities and LEPA characterize the order as finding         that a proposal for zonal rates must overcome a heavy burden, license plate rates have         become the norm in the decades since the order was issued.282         119. The City of New Orleans also argues that Lafayette Utilities and LEPA’s, and         Joint Customers’ arguments that Entergy has historically used a single system-wide rate         no longer applies because MISO, not Entergy or ITC Holdings, will be responsible for         dispatching Entergy’s transmission and generation system in concert with the rest of         MISO. The City of New Orleans cites the elimination of rate pancaking under MISO’s         rate structure and the pending departures of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and         Entergy Texas from the Entergy System Agreement as evidence that Entergy will be         operating under a new paradigm. Based on these changes, the City of New Orleans         concludes that there is no reason to treat the Entergy/ITC Holdings transmission system         differently from the transmission systems of other MISO Transmission Owners.283 The         Arkansas Commission also points out that the Commission has made clear that despite         the history of the Entergy System Agreement and operations thereunder, there is no basis         to support a “request for…involuntary continuation of the existing integrated system         arrangements, or the virtual equivalent, in perpetuity.”284         120. The City of New Orleans also responds to the argument that a single system rate         has mitigated the adverse impacts of natural disasters by pointing out that under MISO,         the Entergy Operating Companies and the New ITC Operating Companies will be part of         a much larger system and will have access to support by all of MISO’s members during         emergencies.285 With respect to operating company-specific transmission pricing zones,         the City of New Orleans further argues that Entergy has committed to establish an         Entergy Arkansas-only transmission pricing zone and an Entergy New Orleans-only                 281                     City of New Orleans Feb. 6Response at 7-8, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 282                     City of New Orleans Feb. 6 Response at 8-9, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 283                     City of New Orleans Feb. 6 Response at 3-4, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 284                     Arkansas Commission Feb. 6Answer at 8 (quoting Louisiana Public Service         Commission v.

The City of New Orleans contends that these commitments         are consistent with the Commission’s policies regarding utility-specific license-plate rates         and the practices prevalent in MISO, PJM and other RTOs.286         121. Lastly, the City of New Orleans argues that Lafayette Utilities and LEPA, and         Joint Customers rely on old cases that pre-date significant changes in the RTO and         regulatory landscape since the early 1990s, such as the PJM Zonal Rate Case.287         Additionally, the City of New Orleans asserts that the single tariff and system-wide rate         requirement for holding companies in Order No. 888 reflects the world under the Public         Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which required a public utility holding company         to operate its affiliated companies as a single system. The City of New Orleans contends         that if the requirement for a single-system wide rate across affiliated companies still         existed, then none of the companies identified by the City of New Orleans would be         permitted to have utility-specific transmission pricing zones for their affiliated         companies.288                                       iv.    Commission Determination         122. We accept the Entergy Operating Companies’ proposed transmission pricing         zones, as well as ITC Holdings’ proposal to adopt the zones approved for the Entergy         Operating Companies. Our acceptance is based on the fact that, contrary to Joint         Customers assertion that Entergy has proposed no change in operations to justify this         change, the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies into MISO will significantly         alter the way service over the Entergy system is provided and priced. As explained in         more detail below, operations over Entergy’s transmission assets will change         dramatically as MISO will be the entity administering transmission service over         Entergy’s transmission system. Accordingly, we find that the proposal is consistent with         the use of license plate pricing in MISO.         123. While the Entergy Operating Companies have provided transmission service on         their system at a single system average rate under the Entergy OATT, upon the Entergy         Operating Companies’ proposed integration into MISO, service will be provided on a                  286                      Id. at 10-11.                  287                      City of New Orleans Feb. 6 Response at 6 (citing PJM Zonal Rate Case,         81 FERC ¶ 61,257 at 62,249, Docket No. ER12-2681-000).                  288                      City of New Orleans Feb. 6 Response at 6-7, Docket No. ER12-2681-000. See         also City of New Orleans Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 4-6, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                     - 60 -         regional basis over the entire MISO system and priced using MISO’s license plate zonal         rate design. Under the license plate zonal rate design, customers pay a single non-         pancaked rate based on the cost of existing facilities and new local facilities in their         pricing zone, plus the cost of new regional facilities allocated to that zone or shared         regionally, and have access to the entire MISO system. In other words, the Entergy         Operating Companies are joining an RTO that has received approval to implement         license plate pricing and the TPZ Filing would implement that license plate pricing upon         integration. This change in the way that service is provided and priced over Entergy’s         transmission system supports the use of multiple transmission pricing zones, which         allows Entergy to adopt the current zonal structure in MISO. Additionally, the         integration of the Entergy Operating Companies into MISO is a unique situation of a         large, multi-operating company system that covers multiple states, rather than a single         company. Moreover, the zonal configuration only applies to the costs of existing         facilities and new local reliability facilities, and other facilities will be subject to broader         regional cost sharing under the MISO Tariff.         124. We note that of the several cited cases that allegedly require the continuation of a         single system rate, some pre-date the formation of ISOs and RTOs with license plate         pricing.289 Further, we note that the PJM Zonal Rate Case cited by Joint Customers was         issued at the inception of license plate pricing under a regional transmission tariff, before         the Commission gained experience with implementation of license plate pricing in PJM         and other ISOs and RTOs. Since the PJM Zonal Rate Case, the Commission has become         more flexible with respect to license plate pricing, and has accepted its continued use for         existing and new local facilities on a long-term basis, and accepted reconfigurations of         license plate pricing zones that deviate from historical configurations.290         125. Moreover, we disagree with protestors that the four transmission pricing zones         would be inconsistent with or frustrate storm recovery settlements accepted by the         Commission. The protestors’ primary concern relates to how the securitized costs will be                 289                     See, e.g., Entergy Services, Inc., 58 FERC ¶ 61,234 at 61,769; Southern Co.

However, the Entergy Operating         Companies explain that they will honor the existing settlement agreements.291 As         Entergy and MISO further explain, the securitization costs will be recovered in the zone         where the storms occurred.292 Accordingly, we find the Entergy Operating Companies’         proposal to recover securitization costs in the zone where the storms occurred is         consistent with their proposal to establish transmission pricing zones for the Entergy         Operating Companies’ transmission system.         126. Finally, with respect to arguments that the equalization of transmission costs         among the Entergy Operating Companies under Service Schedule MSS-2 of the Entergy         System Agreement justifies continuation of a single system rate, we find that the zonal         rate proposal is not incompatible with cost allocations under the Entergy System         Agreement – the implementation of the license plate zonal rate design under the MISO         Tariff is separate and apart from how the Entergy Operating Companies allocate their         costs among themselves under their long-term power pooling agreement.         127. Therefore, we find the Entergy Operating Companies’ transmission pricing zones         proposal to be just and reasonable. We recognize that additional negotiations are on-         going with respect to the transmission pricing zones but are not properly before the         Commission at this time. Accordingly, our acceptance of the Entergy Operating         Companies’ transmission pricing zone proposal is without prejudice to Entergy making         an additional filing seeking to establish a fifth zone for the Entergy New Orleans service         territory.                                 f.    Parallel Loop Flow Issues         128. Several parties argue that parallel loop flow issues will occur as a result of the         integration of Entergy’s transmission facilities into MISO. Specifically, SPP and         the SPP Transmission Owners,293 Associated Electric Cooperative,294 TVA,295 and                 291                     TPZ Filing at 15.                 292                     Entergy Operating Companies Apr. 9 Answer at 16, Docket No. ER13-948-         000.                 293                     See, e.g., SPP Jan. 22 Comments on Application, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 294                     See, e.g., Associated Electric Cooperative Jan. 22 Protest of Application         at 13-15.                 295                     See, e.g., TVA Jan. 22 Protest of Application, Docket No. ER12-2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 62 -         Exelon296 express concerns that the integration of the Entergy transmission facilities into         MISO will cause loop flows in SPP, the Associated Electric Cooperative transmission         system, the TVA transmission system, and PJM, respectively. As explained further         below, we find that existing arrangements are in place that address power flows between         MISO and certain neighboring regions. However, we also note that parties are currently         negotiating potential amendments to existing joint operating agreements (JOAs) or         entirely new JOAs, and find that concerns regarding parallel loop flow issues are more         appropriately addressed through those negotiations. Nonetheless, the Commission         acknowledges the concerns raised by MISO’s neighboring regions. Accordingly, we will         require MISO to file an informational report, on or by November 1, 2013, providing the         Commission with an update on the status of the negotiations to address those concerns.         129. Regarding the consideration of parallel loop flow issues in the JOAs between         neighboring regions, we note that MISO and SPP are parties to a JOA (MISO-SPP JOA),         which governs interregional coordination between them.297 We also note that the         Commission has recognized that the transfer of control of the Entergy transmission         facilities to MISO necessitates the renegotiation of the MISO-SPP JOA.298 Additionally,         MISO and PJM are parties to a JOA, which also governs the interregional coordination         between them. Under the Congestion Management Process incorporated into these         JOAs,299 historic allocations are used to set limits of market flows and those historic         allocations are honored when selling firm transmission service.                 296                     See, e.g., Exelon Jan. 30 Comments on Application, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                 297                     SPP and MISO entered into the MISO-SPP JOA as part of SPP’s application to         become an RTO. See Southwest Power Pool, Inc., 106 FERC ¶ 61,110, at P 63 (2004)         (requiring SPP to have on file with the Commission a seams agreement with MISO and         to participate in the Joint and Common Market with MISO and PJM).                 298                     Midwest Indep.

The Congestion Management Process         requires, among other things, the identification of impacted flowgates, allocates the         capacity of those flowgates based on historic use to serve native load, and requires each         entity to respect those allocations in the dispatch of their systems. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 63 -         130. Also, it appears that TVA is considered a Reciprocal Entity under the MISO-PJM         JOA.300 As mentioned in a previous Commission order on the MISO-SPP JOA, TVA         does not have a reciprocal coordination agreement with MISO or SPP, but MISO, SPP,         and TVA respect each other’s flowgate allocations.301 Thus, although MISO and TVA         do not have a bilateral agreement that incorporates the Congestion Management Process,         it appears that MISO is nonetheless required to treat TVA as a Reciprocal Entity under         the MISO-PJM Congestion Management Process and therefore treat its flowgates with         TVA as reciprocal coordinated flowgates. Finally, MISO offers seams service that         incorporates the Congestion Management Process, under Module F of its Tariff, to all of         its neighboring utilities on a non-discriminatory basis.                                       i.    Protests         131. Several protestors raise concerns about the Entergy-ITC Transaction resulting in         loop flows that will negatively affect adjacent transmission facilities, affecting the         transmission provider’s ability to serve its load.302 SPP Transmission Owners argue that         the Application and related filings, read in conjunction with the Commission’s rulings on         the MISO-SPP JOA, suggest that absent revisions to the JOA, MISO will be able to use         the SPP transmission system to perform energy transfers between MISO and Entergy                 300                     See TVA Apr. 29 Motion to Strike at n.5, Docket No. ER13-948-000. In its         motion, TVA explains that it is important to note that MISO terminated the Joint         Reliability Coordination Agreement with TVA after TVA refused to accept a revisionist         interpretation of a key provision. As a result, there is no bilateral agreement between         TVA and MISO regarding the Congestion Management Process, and MISO must treat         TVA as a “Reciprocal Entity” due to its JOA with PJM. TVA adds that, should the         MISO-PJM JOA be terminated, superseded, or amended, or should TVA’s Joint         Reliability Coordination Agreement with PJM be terminated, superseded, or amended,         that indirect link to treat TVA as a Reciprocal Entity under the Congestion Management         Process could be severed. A Reciprocal Entity is defined as an entity that coordinates the         future-looking management of flowgate capability in accordance with a reciprocal         agreement as described in the Congestion Management Process. PJM and MISO Joint         Operating Agreement, § 2.2.55.                 301                     Southwest Power Pool. Inc., 140 FERC ¶ 61,199, at PP 13, 42 (2012) (the         Commission explained that while TVA does not have a reciprocal coordination         agreement with MISO or SPP, MISO, SPP, and TVA must respect each other’s flowgate         allocations).                 302                     See, e.g., TVA, Associated Electric Cooperative, SPP, Kansas City Power &         Light, the Kansas Commission, Exelon, and SPP Transmission Owners. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                              - 64 -         without any compensation for this use of the SPP transmission system.303 SPP         Transmission Owners assert that allowing Entergy to join MISO without resolving loop         flow issues would exacerbate the negative financial impacts already suffered by the SPP         Transmission Owners as a result of existing uncompensated loop flows. SPP         Transmission Owners further contend that the need to identify the “contract path”         available for MISO’s use to accommodate power flows to and from Entergy is critical.304         132. SPP asserts that without revisions, the JOA’s “firm flow entitlement” provisions         will limit the firm transfers between MISO and Entergy and that the Commission         should find that during periods of congestion, MISO must remove from SPP’s         transmission system any Entergy transactions causing power flows to exceed the         “Historical Firm Flow” entitlement established by the JOA.305 Additionally, SPP         contends that the Commission should either limit the extent of the hourly MISO-Entergy         energy transfers to the interconnection capability between MISO and Entergy of, at most,         1,000 megawatts (MW) or condition the transfer on MISO constructing additional direct         interconnection capacity between the systems.306         133. SPP Transmission Owners explain that MISO would integrate Entergy through a         single 1,000 MW interconnection at the southern tip of the existing MISO system,         connecting to the northern tip of Entergy. However, SPP Transmission Owners state that         massive flows of energy would likely traverse the SPP transmission system, particularly         in view of the 14,000 MW of physical capability over multiple interconnections between         the borders of SPP and Entergy, fourteen times greater than the physical interconnectivity                 303                     Kansas City Power & Light and the Kansas Commission each filed comments         stating that they support SPP Transmission Owners’ Jan. 11 protest of the Application.                 304                     SPP Transmission Owners Jan. 11 Protest of Application at 18, Docket         No. ER12-2681-000.                 305                     We note that the Commission did not agree with SPP’s interpretation of the         MISO-SPP JOA in the MISO-SPP JOA Order. In that order, the Commission found that         section 5.2 of the SPP JOA would allow for the sharing of available contract path         transmission capacity between MISO and Entergy Arkansas, and SPP and Entergy         Arkansas in the event that Entergy Arkansas becomes a Transmission Owner in MISO.         See MISO-SPP JOA Order, 136 FERC ¶ 61,010 at P 60.                 306                     SPP Jan. 22 Comments on Application at 14-15, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.         SPP makes similar arguments, supported by AEP, in its protest of the TPZ Filing. See         SPP Mar. 22 Comments on TPZ Filing at 9; American Electric Power Protest of TPZ         Filing at 3. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 65 -         between the borders of MISO and Entergy. SPP Transmission Owners maintain that SPP         has an aggressive transmission expansion program, but absent Commission intervention         to ensure a fair resolution of the JOA negotiations, it is likely the New ITC Operating         Companies would use the upgrades that have been and continue to be constructed for the         benefit of, and paid for, by SPP transmission customers. SPP Transmission Owners         argue that this result is unjust and unreasonable and inconsistent with the public interest         because costs are not allocated to those who cause the costs to be incurred.307         134. TVA expresses concern regarding how Entergy will be integrated into the         Congestion Management Process308 and has not seen any evidence that the Congestion         Management Process, in its present form, would be able to mitigate the impacts due to         the change in loop flows that would occur with Entergy’s integration into the MISO         market. TVA states that it is unknown whether generating facilities in the Entergy         footprint will be redesignated as network resources for loads in the MISO market, and         whether (and how) such resources will be capped given Entergy’s limited interface         capacity with MISO. TVA points out that MISO has stated it has not conducted any         reliability studies focusing on integrating Entergy into its market and the possible shifts         in flow patterns. TVA therefore requests that the Commission require MISO to conduct         the necessary studies to show the effects of loop flows on adjacent transmission systems         resulting from the integration of Entergy into MISO.309 Associated Electric Cooperative         and Exelon agree with TVA.310         135. TVA further states that it has conducted its own reliability studies which         demonstrate that the loop flows related to the Entergy integration will cause significant         adverse impacts on the TVA transmission system. TVA contends that its studies show         that, under various scenarios, approximately 40 percent of Entergy-MISO flows will flow         over the TVA transmission system, overloading between 12 and 70 transmission         facilities.

Several protestors argue that the Commission should hold neighboring         transmission systems harmless from the loop flows that will result from the Entergy-ITC         Transaction.314 SPP argues that in Commonwealth Edison315 the Commission found that         neighboring systems must be held harmless from the effects of a utility’s decision to join         an RTO. The Commission granted Commonwealth Edison and American Electric Power         Service Corporation’s (American Electric Power) request to join PJM, conditioned on the         requirement that MISO’s member-utilities be held harmless from the financial and         operational consequences of the Commonwealth Edison’s and American Electric Power’s         integrations.                                      ii.

Applicants contend that the Entergy-ITC         Transaction involves a change in ownership of transmission assets and bears no relation         to the loop flow arguments that are premised on mistaken assumptions regarding changes         in generation dispatch.317 Therefore, Applicants argue that the Commission should reject         the protests on this issue as beyond the scope of these proceedings. Additionally,         Applicants contend that the relief protestors requested – forced renegotiation of the         MISO-SPP JOA – should be denied as premature because SPP and MISO have not yet         commenced discussions regarding a renegotiated JOA.318 Applicants further point out         that the Commission has already recognized that completing the renegotiation of the JOA         is not a precondition to the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies into         MISO.319         138. Applicants also contend that SPP Transmission Owners’ request for loop flow         compensation is premature until MISO and SPP conclude their negotiations regarding the         JOA. Applicants assert that even if such compensation claims were relevant to these         proceedings, there is no basis to reconsider them. Additionally, Applicants maintain that         the protests are speculative and provide no basis for injecting this issue into these         proceedings.320         139.

Entergy and MISO also assert that         the existing market-to-non-market protocols in the Congestion Management Process,         which also apply to MISO’s management of TVA’s flowgates, are sufficient to manage         congestion with SPP in the interim.                 319                     Applicants Feb. 1 Answer at 3-4 (citing Midwest Indep.

Entergy and MISO also state that the Congestion Management Process included in         MISO’s Joint Operating Agreement with SPP, and used by MISO and TVA, was         designed to address seams issues of the type raised here. More specifically, Entergy and         MISO state that the Congestion Management Process requires identification of impacted         flowgates, allocates the capacity of those flowgates based on historical use to service         native load, and requires each entity to respect those allocations in the dispatch of their         systems. Because of the existence of this Commission-approved mechanism, Entergy         and MISO state that SPP and TVA are wrong to contend that “MISO can usurp their         transmission systems” following the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies.322                                       iii.   Responses         141. SPP Transmission Owners and Associated Electric Cooperative take issue with         Applicants’ assertion that loop flow issues have no connection to this proceeding and         have no merit. SPP Transmission Owners argue that while the impact of the merger and         integration of Entergy into MISO cannot be determined fully until the JOA is         renegotiated, there is no basis for concluding that such renegotiations should be delayed         until after Entergy is integrated into MISO. SPP Transmission Owners and Associated         Electric Cooperative argue that the impact of loop flows is a critical fact relating to the         justness and reasonableness of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, including integration into         MISO, which must be approved by state and federal regulatory authorities as a condition         precedent to closing the Entergy-ITC Transaction.323 Associated Electric Cooperative         agrees with SPP Transmission Owners’ arguments and also contends that Applicants         cannot credibly deny that this transfer will alter flows across the Eastern Interconnection,         nor can Applicants credibly meet their burden to show that transmission service will         continue to be just and reasonable without even studying the loop flow impacts of the         Entergy-ITC Transaction.324 Associated Electric Cooperative contends that if Applicants                 321                     Entergy and MISO Apr. 16 Answer at 4, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 322                     Id.                 323                     SPP Transmission Owners Feb. 14 Answer at 4, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 324                     Associated Electric Cooperative Mar. 4 Answer at 8-9, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 69 -         cannot produce studies to demonstrate that loop flows resulting from Entergy’s         integration into MISO will not have a negative impact on Associated Electric         Cooperative’s transmission system and generating resources, the Commission should         order Applicants to hold Associated Electric Cooperative harmless from adverse loop         flows caused by the Entergy-ITC Transaction. 325         142. SPP Transmission Owners assert that allegations that SPP has delayed the         renegotiation of the JOA by 18 months do not support a conclusion that the finalization         of such renegotiations can take place after the merger.326 SPP Transmission Owners urge         the Commission to appoint a settlement judge to oversee the renegotiation of the JOA to         address the loop flow issues in a timely manner that will allow the Commission to         consider such renegotiations as part of the overall evaluation of whether the Entergy-ITC         Transaction, including the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies into MISO, is         in the public interest.327         143. TVA moves to strike the answer filed by Entergy and MISO. TVA states that the         answer contains rehashed arguments and mischaracterizations.328 TVA also asserts that         MISO and Entergy have had no incentive and have shown no interest in resolving TVA’s         loop flow concerns.329         144. TVA states that its studies demonstrate that the current practice under the         Congestion Management Process will do little to mitigate the impacts on the TVA         transmission system, as the firm flow allocations that limit firm market flows have little         relation to current system conditions or system reliability limits. TVA also states that         different flowgate attributes and “higher of” allocation logic create total allocation         amounts well above real-time flowgate ratings.330 Additionally, TVA points out that the         independent study cited by Entergy and MISO honors the 1,000 MW contract path limit         between Entergy and MISO, which Entergy and MISO ignore. Moreover, TVA contends         that MISO has no intention of honoring this limit since the Commission determined that         section 5.2 of the MISO-SPP Joint Operating Agreement provides for SPP and MISO to                 325                     Id. at 10.                 326                     SPP Transmission Owners Feb. 14 Answer at 4, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 327                     Id. at 5.                 328                     TVA Apr. 29 Motion to Strike at 1, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 329                     Id. at 2.                 330                     Id. at 2-3. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 70 -         share their contract path capacity.331 TVA states that, instead of having a single physical         1,000 MW connection, Entergy and MISO can now utilize up to 14,000 MW of capacity         through the Entergy-SPP ties. Because the TVA transmission system carries         approximately 40 percent of the flows between Entergy and MISO, TVA asserts that         flows in excess of 1,000 MW will create significant reliability impacts on TVA.332 TVA         also states that Entergy and MISO offer no reliability study or other evidence to rebut         TVA’s findings and that the study cited by Entergy and MISO relies upon outdated         information.333         145. SPP states that its concerns are not premature, as the MISO-SPP JOA Order cited         by Entergy and MISO did not state that SPP’s concerns should be raised in a future         proceeding. Additionally, SPP argues that the duty of SPP and MISO to renegotiate the         Joint Operating Agreement’s terms does not render premature the need to investigate the         issues raised by SPP. Furthermore, SPP argues that the significant impacts that will         result from the integration of Entergy’s system into MISO cannot be addressed through         the Congestion Management Process’ real-time flowgate coordination procedures.334         SPP also considers it inconsistent for Entergy and MISO to argue that the current         Congestion Management Process offers adequate protection to address SPP’s concerns         while it has been acknowledged that the Joint Operating Agreement needs to be revisited         to accommodate MISO’s membership change.335 SPP argues that if Entergy and MISO         believe that the Congestion Management Process is sufficient to address SPP’s concerns,         it is unlikely to reach an agreement with SPP in the Joint Operating Agreement         renegotiation process.336 Finally, SPP argues that the existence of factual disputes         between SPP, Entergy Services, MISO, and others reinforces the need for a thorough                 331                     Section 5.2 (Sharing Contract Path Capacity) of the implementing provisions of         the MISO-SPP JOA provides, in relevant part, “[i]f the Parties have contract paths to the         same entity, the combined contract path capacity will be made available for use by both         Parties.”                 332                     TVA Apr. 29 Motion to Strike at 2-3, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 333                     Id. at 4.                 334                     SPP May 2 Answer at 8, Docket No. ER13-948-00.                 335                     Id.                 336                     Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 71 -         investigation into the reliability, economic, and operational impacts of the Entergy/MISO         integration.337                                       iv.     Answer to Responses         146. Entergy and MISO take issue with SPP’s contention that the assumed loop flows         resulting from Entergy’s integration into MISO cannot be addressed through the         Congestion Management Process’ real-time flowgate coordination procedures. In         particular, Entergy and MISO state that the Congestion Management Process allocates         capacity at particular flowgates and requires MISO to redispatch its system to reduce         flows to honor its firm flow allocation or, if a market-to-market protocol was in effect,         compensate SPP (or TVA) for its redispatch costs for MISO’s market flows in excess of         its firm allocation if the flowgate becomes congested.338 Entergy and MISO therefore         question what SPP and TVA seek to be held harmless from, as they have never been         specific about the relief that they request. Entergy and MISO surmise that they may         object to MISO’s Firm Flowgate Entitlements or disagree with the fact that the         Congestion Management Process imposes a five percent flow threshold for designating         coordinated flowgates rather than a lower figure.339 Entergy and MISO state that such         objections would be attacks on the filed rate itself. If that is the case, according to         Entergy and MISO, SPP and TVA have no right to be held harmless from the terms of the         Congestion Management Process. Instead, they argue that SPP and TVA must negotiate         in good faith with MISO to determine whether the parties can agree upon any         modifications to the Joint Operating Agreement or Congestion Management Process.340                                       v.      Commission Determination         147. We note that, although there are existing arrangements in place to handle power         flows as a result of Entergy’s integration, parties to this proceeding have expressed         concern about the sufficiency of the existing arrangements. We also note that some of         the parties are currently in negotiations over potential modifications to these existing         arrangements or the establishment of new agreements to resolve their respective issues.         We strongly encourage the parties to continue to work together to resolve these issues,         and remain interested in the status of those negotiations.                 337                     Id. at 9.                 338                     Entergy and MISO May 8 Answer at 3, Docket No. ER13-948-000.                 339                     Id.                 340                     Id. at 6. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 72 -         148. With respect to the arguments that the Commission should require Applicants to         hold parties harmless from potential parallel and loop flows, we note that Commonwealth         Edison is distinguishable from this proceeding because the hold harmless remedy         established in that case for utilities in Wisconsin and Michigan was developed to mitigate         the geographic separation of utilities in those two states resulting from Commonwealth         Edison and American Electric Power’s decisions to join PJM. Thus, the hold harmless         remedy for utilities in Wisconsin and Michigan was not established to address loop or         parallel flows per se, but rather geographic separation of certain utilities from the rest of         their RTO, a situation that does not exist here.         149. We also note that, at the time of the Commonwealth Edison proceeding, the         present day RTOs were just forming and had not established arrangements to coordinate         flows on neighboring transmission systems. Since then, however, to address issues such         as these, RTOs have developed joint operating agreements, with mechanisms to         coordinate parallel flows, such as the coordination in the Congestion Management         Process, which is used in a number of seams agreements between the RTOs and their         neighbors. The Congestion Management Process forms the basis for coordination of         parallel flows between MISO and SPP under the MISO-SPP JOA, and is included in the         seams service that MISO offers under Module F of its Tariff to all of its neighboring         utilities, including TVA and Associated Electric Cooperative, on a non-discriminatory         basis. The Congestion Management Process, further enhanced by market-to-market         coordination, is also included in the MISO-PJM JOA. The Congestion Management         Process requires, among other things, the identification of impacted flowgates, and the         allocation of the capacity of those flowgates based on historic use to serve native load,         and requires each entity to respect those allocations in the dispatch of their systems, or,         where market-to-market coordination is in place, compensate the other party for         redispatch costs of market flows in excess of the allocation.         150. With respect to the arguments concerning loop flows over the SPP transmission         system, we note that the renegotiation of the MISO-SPP JOA is ongoing. In the MISO-         SPP JOA Order, MISO petitioned the Commission to interpret a provision in section 5.2         of the MISO-SPP JOA regarding the availability of transmission path sharing under the         agreement. In the order, the Commission found in favor of MISO but recognized SPP’s         statement that the MISO-SPP JOA should be renegotiated pursuant to its terms and noted         that MISO and SPP are obligated to negotiate in good faith in response to revisions either         party might propose.341 Subsequently, in conditionally approving SPP’s Integrated         Marketplace, the Commission required SPP to begin negotiations with MISO on         developing a market-to-market coordination process for managing congestion across the                 341                     MISO-SPP JOA Order, 136 FERC ¶ 61,010 at P 64. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 73 -         seam of MISO and SPP, and required SPP to file a phase 2 MISO-SPP JOA by June 30,         2013.342 In accordance with these orders, MISO and SPP are currently renegotiating the         MISO-SPP JOA in order to address congestion across the seam between the two RTOs.         Interested parties will be free to challenge the terms of the revised MISO-SPP JOA when         it is filed with the Commission. Should MISO and SPP fail to reach agreement, they may         petition the Commission for modifications to their JOA.343         151. In addition to parties raising issues regarding flows over the SPP transmission         system, Exelon raises similar arguments with respect to flows over PJM; TVA raises         similar arguments with respect to flows over the TVA transmission system; and         Associated Electric Cooperative raises similar concerns with respect to flows over its         transmission system. We note that the joint operating agreement between MISO and         PJM, and their market-to-market coordination processes, address parallel flows across         PJM. In contrast, TVA and Associated Electric do not have agreements in place with         MISO or SPP to address such flows, but are in the process of negotiating new agreements         with MISO to address their concerns.         152. Accordingly, we direct MISO, on or by November 1, 2013, to file an         informational report detailing the status of the negotiations regarding revisions to existing         JOAs or the development of new JOAs to address the loop flow concerns, with SPP,         TVA, and Associated Electric Cooperative.         153. Finally, the pleadings indicate that all of the parties are currently engaged in         discussions regarding the adequacy of MISO’s reliability plan in light of the integration         of Entergy’s transmission assets into MISO. We note that MISO is obligated to comply         with mandatory and enforceable requirements set forth in the NERC’s Reliability         Standards.                  342                      Southwest Power Pool, Inc., 141 FERC ¶ 61,048, at P 364 (2012), order on         reh’g, 142 FERC ¶ 61,205 (2013).                  343                      See MISO-SPP JOA Rehearing Order, 138 FERC ¶ 61,055 at n.53 (“If and         when Entergy Arkansas joins MISO, and if and when MISO utilizes the provisions in the         [MISO-SPP JOA], whatever they might be at such time, then parties may file a complaint         [] under [FPA section 206] if they believe the terms of the MISO-SPP JOA are unjust,         unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential.”). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 74 -                                g.     Approval of the New ITC Operating Companies’                                       Participation in MISO as Appendix I Members                                       i.      Proposal         154. Applicants state that Appendix I of the MISO TOA provides for the operation of         independent transmission companies like the New ITC Operating Companies in MISO         and allows for the assignment to an independent transmission company of certain         responsibilities that otherwise would reside in MISO.344 Applicants explain that only         independent transmission companies whose structure and governance ensure that they are         fully independent from any market participants are eligible for Appendix I membership in         MISO.345 Additionally, Applicants state that independent transmission companies must         be of sufficient size and configuration to assume the rights, responsibilities, and functions         proposed.346         155. Applicants state that the New ITC Operating Companies will sign the MISO TOA         and will also enter into an agreement with MISO under Appendix I of the MISO TOA         (Appendix I Agreement).347 Section 3 of the Appendix I Agreement contains a detailed         explanation of the rights, responsibilities and functions that the New ITC Operating         Companies will assume, including general rights to: redistribute revenues to the New ITC         Operating Companies; file with the Commission a mechanism for determining loss         responsibility; establish rates, terms and conditions of service; establish ratings and         operating procedures and maintenance and outage schedules; plan for construction of         facilities; perform billing, crediting and accounting responsibilities; and establish terms         and conditions of generator interconnection service.348 Applicants state that these         provisions are derived substantially from the pro forma Appendix I and from comparable         agreements and tariff provisions previously approved by the Commission, including the         ITC Midwest Appendix I Agreement.349 Applicants state that with respect to the                 344                     Application at 60.                 345                     Id. at 61.                 346                     Id.                 347                     Id. at 60.                 348                     Id. at 63.

Applicants also state that the Entergy-ITC Transaction will result in the         independent ownership and operation of the transmission assets by the New ITC         Operating Companies, and that the Entergy-ITC Transaction (including the proposed         exchange trust election)351 has been structured to address any potential Commission         concerns regarding ITC Holdings’ independence from market participants.352 Applicants         state that Entergy will have no ability to control or influence ITC Holdings’ in any         respect as a consequence of the trust, but instead the trustee will be obligated to vote the         shares it holds in trust in the same proportion as all other ITC Holdings shares are         voted.353 Applicants explain that since Entergy will not own any ITC Holdings shares, it         will have no ability to affect the way that the shares held by the trustee are voted.354         157. Applicants state that the New ITC Operating Companies will be fully independent         transmission companies within MISO.355 Applicants explain that ITC Holdings adheres         to stringent requirements to secure and preserve its independence and that of its         jurisdictional operating companies.356 Applicants also reiterate that the New ITC                 350                     Id.                 351                     As part of their requests under FPA section 203, Applicants state that, under the         terms of the Merger Agreement and as part of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, Entergy may         make an exchange trust election. Applicants explain that, at least 30 days prior to the         closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, Entergy may elect to retain and subsequently         transfer to an irrevocable trust (the Exchange Trust) the number of limited liability         company membership common units in Entergy Mid South that would convert in the         Entergy-ITC Transaction to up to 4.99 percent of the total number of shares of ITC         Holdings common stock outstanding immediately following consummation of the         Proposed Transaction.

Applicants state that all of the safeguards now in place to protect the independence         of ITC Holdings will remain in place after the Entergy-ITC Transaction is completed.363         Applicants explain that ITC Holdings adheres to a more rigorous standard of         independence than the Commission’s Independence Policy Statement,364 and that the         Commission has previously found ITC Holdings’ standards of independence sufficient to                 357                     Id.                 358                     Id.                 359                     Id.

Applicants further explain that another purpose of the Appendix I Agreement is to         facilitate integration of the former Entergy transmission assets into MISO upon the         closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction. Applicants state that they have developed an         integration plan that will enable the New ITC Operating Companies to become         Transmission Owners in MISO and to place the transmission facilities under MISO’s         functional control upon closing. Applicants explain that MISO will then become the         transmission provider and reliability coordinator for the New ITC Operating Companies’         transmission systems. Applicants state that because the Entergy-ITC Transaction is         expected to close before the Entergy Operating Companies join MISO as market         participants in December 2013, it is necessary to create a mechanism for MISO’s         provision of transmission service on the New ITC Operating Companies facilities during         the short period of time between closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction and the Entergy         Operating Companies’ entry into MISO.369 To establish this mechanism, Applicants         state that: (1) MISO will file temporary amendments to its Tariff (new Module B-1) for         Commission approval;370 (2) via the Appendix I Agreement, MISO will delegate certain                 365                     Id. at 62 (citing ITC Midwest, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229 at P 87).                 366                     Id. at 62-63.                 367                     Id. at 63.                 368                     Id.                 369                     Id. at 64.                 370                     Applicants state that Module B-1, which was proposed in the Module B-1         Filing and is the subject of an order issued concurrently with this order, will be used to         retain certain methodologies and business practices currently used under the Entergy         OATT until the Entergy Operating Companies are fully integrated into the MISO market.         Applicants state that these provisions of Module B-1 relate to the provision of ancillary         services; processing of transmission service requests; Weekly Procurement Process;         transmission service request and loss compensation procedures; transmission planning                                                                                        (continued…) 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 78 -         functions of Module B-1 to the New ITC Operating Companies;371 and (3) Entergy will         file with the Commission a stand-alone Ancillary Services Tariff under which the         Entergy Balancing Authority Area Operator will provide ancillary services to customers         taking service under the proposed Module B-1 during the transition period.         160. Applicants explain that this approach is necessary to enable the Entergy-ITC         Transaction to close as contemplated in June 2013 upon receipt of all necessary         regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of all other conditions precedent under the         Merger Agreement.372 Applicants assert that the integration of the transmission assets         into MISO at closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction will accelerate the benefits of ITC         Holdings’ independent model, enhanced credit quality and operational excellence         resulting from ITC Holdings’ singular focus on transmission.373 Applicants further         explain that it will also enable the earliest possible implementation of ITC Holdings’         proven approaches to transmission system operations, maintenance and planning.         Additionally, Applicants state that it would enable the Entergy Transmission assets to         become part of the MISO MTEP 2014 planning process upon its commencement in         June 2013.374                                       ii.     Protests         161. Joint Customers state that many of the responsibilities under the Appendix I         Agreement between the New ITC Operating Companies and MISO are proposed to be         permanently assigned to ITC Holdings even though those responsibilities are reserved         solely for MISO as the independent operator of transmission in the other MISO footprint         areas. In particular, Joint Customers are concerned with the following functions being         process; financial and other rights associated with supplemental upgrades; and reporting         and stakeholder involvement. Id. at 65-66.                 371                     Applicants state that section 4 of Appendix I includes the New ITC Operating         Companies’ responsibilities such as: calculation of available flowgate capability;         Weekly Procurement Process; transmission planning; financial payments associated         with supplemental upgrades; and loss compensation during the effective period of         Module B-1.

Joint Customers assert that any transfer of these         responsibilities for the Midsouth area from MISO to ITC Holdings will erode the status         of MISO and place undue authority in the hands of a transmission stakeholder that has a         vested, non-independent interest in the outcome with regard to the planning and operation         of the Midsouth area transmission grid. Joint Customers contend that MISO should not         be permitted to make such a delegation of its duties and responsibilities as a result of the         Entergy-ITC Transaction.375         162. Joint Customers also take issue with special provisions in the proposed Appendix I         Agreement that will only apply during the Interim Period, before the Entergy Operating         Companies are fully integrated into the MISO balancing authority area. Joint customers         point out several additional responsibilities assigned to the New ITC Operating         Companies such as: (1) calculating short term Available Flowgate Capacity; (2)         conducting the Weekly Procurement Process; (3) completing the 2012-2018 Construction         Plan; and (4) paying parties that funded Supplemental Upgrades under the Entergy         OATT. Joint Customers argue that it is not clear that the tariff rates of the New ITC         Operating Companies and MISO properly reflect this assignment of functions and         responsibilities to the New ITC Operating Companies.376 Joint Customers also question         whether the New ITC Operating Companies will double recover for performing the         assigned functions and whether the MISO charges will be the same whether or not the         New ITC Operating Companies are Appendix I companies.377                                      iii.   Answer         163. Applicants contend that Joint Customers fail to appreciate that Appendix I         membership in MISO is only available to fully independent transmission companies.         Applicants disagree with Joint Customers that certain provisions of the Appendix I         Agreement erode MISO’s independent status as well as ITC Holdings’ independence         from market participants with vested interests. Applicants state that the Application         provides detailed protections to ensure that ITC Holdings remains fully independent,                375                    Joint Customers Jan. 22 Protest of Application at 94-96, Docket No. ER12-         2681-000.                376                    Id. at 98.                377                    Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 80 -         which will not be diminished by Entergy shareholders holding 50.1 percent of the shares         of ITC Holdings upon closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction. As Applicants note, the         50.1 percent ownership of ITC Holdings by Entergy shareholders at closing will only be         momentary, and will immediately change as trading occurs in ITC Holdings stock on the         New York Stock Exchange.378 Lastly, Applicants point out that the specific provisions of         Appendix I that Joint Customers take issue with are from Appendix I to the MISO TOA,         and thus are a collateral attack on the Commission-approved TOA Appendix I         provisions.379                                       iv.    Commission Determination         164. We accept Applicants’ proposed Appendix I Agreement to the MISO TOA as just         and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Appendix I of the MISO         TOA provides a framework for an independent transmission company to assume certain         rights and responsibilities that would otherwise belong to MISO. The rights,         responsibilities, and the operational procedures under which MISO and the independent         transmission company would coordinate their operations are determined on a case-by-         case basis.380 As MISO has previously acknowledged, Appendix I of the MISO TOA         “specifically provides that [MISO] remains the ultimate authority on matters of regional         grid security.”381 Further, the functions that ITC Holdings will perform will be done so         under the supervision of or in coordination with MISO.382         165. As Applicants point out, the provisions that Joint Customers challenge are         consistent with Appendix I to the MISO TOA, which the Commission has approved.383         Joint Customers are concerned that MISO is inappropriately delegating its duties as the         independent transmission system operator to ITC Holdings. We disagree. As Applicants         explain in their answer, Appendix I membership in MISO is only available to fully         independent transmission companies. And, as the Commission has previously                 378                     Application, Exhibit No. ETR-100: Bunting Test. at 26: 7-9.                 379                     Applicants Feb. 22 Answer at 53-54, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 380                     Midwest Indep.

As such, if Joint Customers         wish to challenge these specific provisions of Appendix I of the MISO TOA, they must         raise such issues in an FPA section 206 complaint.         166. Additionally, in response to protestors’ arguments that the New ITC Operating         Companies may double recover for functions they are assigned under the Appendix I         Agreement, we clarify that parties may raise in the hearing ordered above whether the         New ITC Operating Companies should recover their costs associated with performing         RTO functions under Appendix I directly from their customers or through other means.385                        3.     Other Issues                               a.     Through-and-out Rate Issues         167. On November 28, 2011, in Docket No. ER12-480-000, MISO and the MISO         Transmission Owners proposed amendments to the MISO Tariff to provide for a         five-year transition period for the integration of Entergy into the MISO transmission         planning and cost allocation process (Entergy Cost Allocation Proceeding). The         Commission conditionally accepted those tariff amendments on April 19, 2012.386                                      i.      Protests         168. Associated Electric Cooperative asserts that Applicants fail to clearly identify the         impact the Entergy-ITC Transaction will have on Associated Electric Cooperative’s         point-to-point transmission service across Entergy’s transmission system, and that the         Commission should require MISO and ITC Holdings to confirm that the transition plan         approved in the Entergy Cost Allocation Order will apply to all of Entergy’s point-to-         point transmission service customers.387 Associated Electric Cooperative states that it is         concerned that it will face a significant increase in its point-to-point transmission rate                 384                     ITC Holdings Corp., 111 FERC ¶ 61,149 at P 25.                 385                     Ameren Services Company, 101 FERC ¶ 61,320, at P 141 (2002).                 386                     Midwest Indep.

According to Associated         Electric Cooperative, based on that rate, its 206 MW of service would cost as much as         $6.4 million per year – a 78 percent increase over the rates Associated Electric         Cooperative currently pays Entergy.390 Thus, Associated Electric Cooperative argues         that, in order to avoid an unjust and unreasonable transmission rate increase, the         Commission should confirm that ITC Holdings and MISO will apply the Entergy         transition plan for Multi-Value Project (MVP) and non-MVP network upgrade costs to         the transmission rates of all of Entergy’s customers, including point-to-point customers         such as Associated Electric Cooperative.391                                      ii.    Answer         169. Applicants state that any changes to the transmission charges paid by Associated         Electric Cooperative, which are the subject of its protest, will result from the Entergy         Operating Companies’ integration into MISO and adoption of the MISO Tariff.392         Applicants argue that, to the extent that the concerns raised by Associated Electric         Cooperative have any validity, those concerns should be raised in the proceedings         initiated by the Commission to review the rate effects of the Entergy Operating         Companies’ integration into MISO.393                                      iii.   Response         170. Associated Electric Cooperative responds that Applicants do not rebut its         argument that Entergy’s integration into MISO will result in an unjust, unreasonable, and                 388                     Id.                 389                     Id.                 390                     Id. at 5-6.                 391                     Id. at 6.                 392                     Applicants Feb. 22, 2013 Answer at 62, Docket No. ER12-2681-000.                 393                     Id. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 83 -         unduly discriminatory 78 percent increase in its point-to-point transmission service across         Entergy’s transmission system.394                                       iv.    Commission Determination         171. We deny Associated Electric Cooperative’s request that the Commission confirm         that ITC Holdings and MISO will apply the Entergy transition plan for MVP and non-         MVP network upgrade costs to the transmission rates of all of Entergy’s customers,         including point-to-point customers like Associated Electric Cooperative. We find that         Associated Electric Cooperative’s request to receive similar treatment as that provided in         the Entergy Cost Allocation proceeding is beyond the scope of this proceeding. We         further note that this issue is being addressed currently in the Entergy Cost Allocation         Proceeding.395 We also disagree with Associated Electric Cooperative’s assertion that it         is not being treated comparably to other Entergy transmission customers. Associated         Electric Cooperative is being treated comparably with other similarly situated customers,         i.e., those customers requesting drive-through service on MISO’s transmission system,         because any other transmission customer seeking drive-through service across Entergy’s         transmission system would be charged the same rate that Associated Electric Cooperative         will be charged. Associated Electric Cooperative, however, appears to be comparing its         service to service of other Entergy customers who will receive service within the         boundaries of MISO transmission pricing zones on the Entergy transmission system.                  394                      Associated Electric Cooperative Mar. 4 Answer at 6, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000.                  395                      Entergy Cost Allocation Order, 139 FERC ¶ 61,056 at P 100:                  Moreover, sections IV.B.4 and IV.B.5 do not address the cost responsibility                  of external entities with export and wheel-through transactions in the                  Planning Areas and, therefore, it is unclear how these transactions could be                  “adjusted” accordingly. Consistent with the requirements of the April 19                  Order, we will require Filing Parties to submit Tariff revisions to                  Attachments FF-6 and/or MM to: 1) provide how individual MVP usage                  rate components would be adjusted during the eight-year phase-in period;                  and 2) ensure that the eight-year phase-in period will apply to export and                  wheel-through transactions by external entities, excluding those that sink in                  PJM. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 84 -                                b.

Applicants state that they will honor all existing agreements.396 Applicants further         explain this commitment in witness testimony:                 Yes, pre-existing transmission agreements under Entergy’s OATT,                 interconnection agreements and Grandfathered Agreements (GFAs) will be                 assigned to ITC. These agreements will continue to be honored. Likewise                 any existing agreements that allow entities to obtain transmission service                 will continue to be honored.397                                       ii.   Protests         173. Joint Customers assert that Applicants must provide an assurance that the         underlying arrangements will not be disturbed, and explain how, where applicable, the         GFAs involving not only transmission services but other services (e.g., generation-related         and wholesale distribution services) will be addressed.398         174. Associated Electric Cooperative states that it, Entergy, and Union Electric         Company (d/b/a Ameren Missouri) (Ameren) have been parties to an Interchange         Agreement since 1977.399 Associated Electric Cooperative explains that the Interchange         Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for the exchange of energy among the         parties along the Missouri-Arkansas EHV Interconnection.400 Associated Electric         Cooperative states that the Missouri-Arkansas EHV Interconnection is the physical path         that interconnects MISO and Entergy.401 Associated Electric Cooperative further                 396                     Application at 23.                 397                     Application, Exhibit No. ITC-100: Prepared Direct Testimony and Exhibits of         Joseph L.

Answer         175. Applicants respond that protestors’ arguments are misplaced.406 Applicants         explain that they are not requesting authority to amend or abrogate any of their existing         contracts. 407 Applicants argue that it is not the function of the Commission, in an FPA         section 203 review, to rule in advance exactly how every existing contract will be         implemented after a merger.408 Applicants further assert that, after the Entergy-ITC         Transaction has closed, to the extent that Joint Customers, Associated Electric, or any         other party to a GFA believes that its contract has been breached, each party will have the         full ability to file an FPA section 206 complaint at the Commission to seek redress for                 402                     Id.                 403                     Id.

In response, Associated Electric Cooperative states that it appreciates Applicants’         concession that the Entergy-ITC Transaction will not alter the rights and obligations         contained within the Interchange Agreement between Associated Electric Cooperative,         Entergy, and Ameren.411                                       iv.    Commission Determination         177. We accept the commitment by Applicants, particularly ITC Holdings, to honor all         existing agreements. While this commitment provides some certainty, we remind         Applicants that they will need to file notices of succession to the existing agreements to         memorialize the Entergy-ITC Transaction. Parties will have the opportunity to raise any         concerns at that time.                                c.     Ancillary Service Agreements                                       i.

Applicants state that the Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement         provides for the interconnection of the New ITC Operating Companies’ transmission         facilities with the Entergy Operating Companies’ distribution facilities and establishes the         rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties. Applicants state that a separate         distribution-transmission interconnection agreement will be executed between each New         ITC Operating Company and its corresponding Entergy Operating Company. Applicants         state that the Commission has approved similar agreements in the past to provide for                 409                     Id.                 410                     Id.                 411                     Associated Electric Cooperative Mar. 4 Answer at 4, Docket No. ER12-2681-         000. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 87 -         clear assignment of rights and responsibilities when transmission is transferred from an         integrated electric utility to an independent transmission system operator.412                                               (b)  Commission Determination         179. We will accept the Distribution-Transmission Interconnection Agreement as filed.         We note that the Commission has previously accepted similar agreements.413                                        ii.    Generator Interconnection Agreement                                               (a)  Proposal         180.    Applicants state that they have agreed on a generator interconnection agreement to         govern the continued interconnection and operation of Entergy’s existing generating         facilities with the New ITC Operating Companies’ transmission systems. Applicants         explain that most of the Entergy Operating Companies’ generating facilities do not have         interconnection agreements because they were built and interconnected prior to Order         No. 2003 and when Entergy owned both the generation and transmission. Applicants         state that after the Entergy-ITC Transaction, the New ITC Operating Companies will own         the transmission facilities formerly owned by the Entergy Operating Companies and         therefore a separate generator interconnection agreement will be executed for each         Entergy Operating Company to govern the continued interconnection and operation of         the existing generating facilities.414 Applicants explain that these generator         interconnection agreements will only include generating facilities that do not have         existing interconnection agreements. Existing executed interconnection agreements of         Entergy generating facilities will be assigned to the appropriate New ITC Operating         Company and remain in effect.415         181.    Applicants state that the form generator interconnection agreement submitted         with the Application is not subject to Order No. 2003 because the existing generating         plants were interconnected before Order No. 2003 was issued. Applicants state that         Order No. 2003 only applies to the interconnection of new generators and expansion of                 412                     Application at 68-69 (citing ITC Midwest, 121 FERC ¶ 61,229 at P 74).

Applicants explain that even though the generator interconnection agreements         to be executed are not subject to Order No. 2003, the Entergy Operating Companies and         ITC Holdings have nevertheless made every effort to conform the generator         interconnection agreements to the requirements of the MISO Tariff. Applicants state that         the generator interconnection agreements will be three-party agreements among each         Entergy Operating Company, the appropriate New ITC Operating Company, and MISO.         Applicants explain that the generator interconnection agreements will consist of the         pro forma Generator Interconnection Agreement in Appendix 6 of MISO’s Generator         Interconnection Procedures, with certain changes to the Recitals to clarify that the         agreement applies to existing generating facilities that are already interconnected to the         transmission system.417         183.    Applicants state that variances between the generator interconnection agreements         and the terms and conditions in the MISO pro forma agreement have been kept to a         minimum and are all contained in Appendix C, which governs the operating requirements         for the existing generating facilities. Applicants note that the operating requirements         contained in Appendix C that may vary from the requirements contained in the         generator interconnection agreement include: section 1.2 (communication requirements         applicable to existing generators); section 1.3 (metering installed for existing generators);         section 1.8 (existing generator reliance on Transmission Owner’s breakers for         protection); section 1.11 (power factor capability); and section 1.13 (governance of         existing nuclear plants).418 Applicants assert that the Commission did not intend to         subject existing generators to the standardized interconnection terms and conditions that         apply to new generation under Order No. 2003. Applicants explain that each potential         variance reflects the original configuration and historic operation of Entergy’s existing         generating facilities and that none of the variances have an adverse impact on system                 416                     Id.                 417                     Id. at 72.                 418                     Id. at 72-73. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 89 -         reliability. Additionally, Applicants state that they will remain fully compliant with all         applicable NERC and Regional Reliability Organization reliability standards.419         184.    Applicants state that if an Entergy Operating Company constructs new generation         or increases the capacity of its existing generation, the requirements of Order No. 2003         will apply to the new construction or increase in capacity. In such a case, Applicants         state that MISO, the appropriate New ITC Operating Company and the applicable         Entergy Operating Company will enter into a new generator interconnection agreement         pursuant to the MISO Tariff that will govern the terms and conditions of the         interconnection of the new construction or increase in capacity.420 Applicants request         that the Commission accept the agreed-upon generator interconnection for filing,         effective as of the closing date of the Entergy-ITC Transaction.                                              (b)    Commission Determination         185. We will accept the Generation Interconnection Agreement. We find that the         variations from the pro forma MISO Generation Interconnection Agreement are just and         reasonable. We find that, because there are no proposed increases in capacity or material         modifications of the characteristics of an existing generating facility, Order No. 2003         does not apply in this instance.421 Accordingly, we accept Applicants’ commitment to         file a new generator interconnection agreement in the event that an Entergy Operating         Company constructs new generation or increases capacity of its existing generation, to         comply with the requirements of Order No. 2003.422                 419                     Id. at 73.                 420                     Id. at 73-74.                 421                     See, e.g., Midwest Indep.

Waiver of E-Tariff Filing Requirements                                       i.     Proposal         186. Applicants state that compliance with the Commission’s eTariff filing         requirements dictates that the formula rates, as well as the rate schedules and         jurisdictional agreements that require Commission approval under FPA section 205, be         filed separately in eTariff format.423 Applicants request a limited partial waiver of the         eTariff filing requirements in sections 35.7 and 35.9 of the Commission’s regulations.424         According to Applicants, this request is limited to the filing of tariff sheets, rate schedules         and agreements whose effectiveness is dependent upon the closing of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction.425 Applicants explain that they are seeking delay in the eTariff requirements         and commit that they will submit four Attachment O formula rate templates (one for each         of the New ITC Operating Companies), rate schedules and jurisdictional agreements, as         they may be revised by the Commission, in a filing in accordance with eTariff         requirements prior to their proposed effective dates.426         187. Applicants contend that good cause exists for the Commission to grant the         requested waiver because the proposed formula rates, rate schedules and jurisdictional         agreements will not become effective until the closing of the Entergy-ITC Transaction.427         Applicants also state that closing is dependent on Commission approval under FPA         section 203, as well as other regulatory approvals. Therefore, Applicants maintain that it         is in the interests of administrative efficiency to defer eTariff filing until the necessary         approvals have been obtained.428 The Entergy Operating Companies also make similar         requests regarding their proposed Attachment O formula rates.429                 423                     Application at 74.                 424                     Id. at 47-48.                 425                     Id. at 48.                 426                     Application at 48.                 427                     Id.                 428                     Id.                 429                     TPZ Filing at 23. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 91 -                                       ii.    Commission Determination         188. We agree with Applicants that it is in the interest of administrative efficiency to         defer filing the formula rates, as well as the rate schedules and jurisdictional agreements         that require Commission approval under FPA section 205, in eTariff until the necessary         regulatory approvals have been obtained for the Entergy Operating Companies’         integration into MISO or the Entergy-ITC Transaction. We accept Applicants’         commitments that they will file timely Attachment O formula rate templates, as they may         be revised by the Commission, in accordance with eTariff requirements prior to the         proposed effective date. Accordingly, we grant waiver of Order No. 714,430 in this         instance, because either Applicants will file clean tariff sheets in eTariff prior to closing         of the Entergy-ITC Transaction, or Entergy will file clean tariff sheets in eTariff if the         Entergy-ITC Transaction is delayed or cancelled.         The Commission orders:                 (A) Applicants’ proposed Attachment O formula rate templates, Schedules 40,         41, 42-A, 42-B, and related agreements, and the OPEB filing, are hereby accepted for         filing, suspended, and made effective subject to refund, to become effective on the date         that the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes, as requested. We also set for hearing and         settlement judge procedures, the remaining issues that were not summarily resolved in         this order.                 (B) The Entergy Operating Companies proposed Attachment O formula rates,         and Schedules 40, 41, 42-A, 42-B are hereby accepted for filing, suspended and made         effective subject to refund, to become effective on December 19, 2013 unless the         Entergy-ITC Transaction closes prior to that date, as requested, subject to refund. We         also set for hearing and settlement judge procedures, the remaining issues that were not         summarily resolved in this order.                 (C) The ITC Applicants and the Entergy Operating Companies are directed to         file, within sixty (60) days of the date of this order, formula rate protocols that comply         with the MISO Protocols Investigation Order, as discussed in the body of this order.                 430                     Electronic Tariff Filings, Order No. 714, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,276 (2008);         18 C.F.R. § 154.4 (2012). 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                    - 92 -                 (D) MISO is directed to file, on or by November 1, 2013, an informational         filing that provides the status of the negotiations regarding revisions to existing JOAs or         the development of new JOAs to address the loop flow concerns, as discussed in the body         of this order.                 (E)    Applicants’ request for waiver of Order No. 714 is hereby granted.         Applicants are directed to file clean tariff sheets in eTariff prior to closing of the Entergy-         ITC Transaction. In the event that the Entergy-ITC Transaction is delayed or cancelled,         Entergy is directed to file clean tariff sheets in eTariff.                 (F)    Pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction         conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by section 402(a) of the         Department of Energy Organization Act and by the FPA, particularly section 205         and 206 thereof, and pursuant to the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure and         the regulations under the Federal Power Act (18 C.F.R., Chapter I), a hearing shall be         held concerning, as described above, the proposed Attachment O formula rate templates         filed by both the ITC Applicants and the Entergy Operating Companies, Schedules 40,         41, 42-A, and 42-B, and certain related agreements filed by Applicants, as well as the         OPEB Filing. However, the hearing shall be held in abeyance to provide time for         settlement judge procedures as discussed in Ordering Paragraphs (H) and (I) below.                 (G) Docket Nos. ER12-2681-000, ER13-948-000, and ER13-782-000 are         hereby consolidated for purposes of hearing and settlement judge procedures.                 (H) Pursuant to Rule 603 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,         18 C.F.R. § 385.603 (2012), the Chief Administrative Law Judge is hereby directed to         appoint a settlement judge in this proceeding within fifteen (15) days of the date of this         order. Such settlement judge shall have all powers and duties enumerated in Rule 603         and shall convene a settlement conference as soon as practicable after the Chief Judge         designates a settlement judge. If the parties decide to request a specific judge, they must         make their request to the Chief Judge within five (5) days of the date of this order.                 (I)    Within thirty (30) days of the date of this order, the settlement judge shall         file a report with the Commission and the Chief Judge on the status of settlement         discussions. Based on this report, the Chief Judge shall provide the parties with         additional time to continue their settlement discussions, if appropriate, or assign this case         to a presiding judge for a trial-type evidentiary hearing, if appropriate. If settlement         discussions continue, the settlement judge shall file a report at least every sixty (60) days         thereafter, informing the Commission and the Chief Judge of the parties' progress toward         settlement. 20130620-3092 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/20/2013         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 93 -                (J)    If settlement judge procedures fail and a trial-type evidentiary hearing is to         be held, a presiding judge, to be designated by the Chief Judge, shall, within fifteen         (15) days of the date of the presiding judge's designation, convene a prehearing         conference in these proceedings in a hearing room of the Commission, 888 First Street,         NE, Washington, DC 20426.

On June 20, 2013, the Commission issued several orders conditionally accepting         proposed tariff revisions submitted under section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA)1         and Part 35 of the regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission         (Commission),2 and accepting and suspending certain proposed tariff revisions and         established hearing and settlement judge procedures.3 The proposed tariff revisions were         filed to effectuate the transfer of the transmission assets of Entergy Corporation (Entergy)         and certain of its subsidiaries4 (together, the Entergy Applicants) to ITC Midsouth, a         newly-created subsidiary of ITC Holdings Corp. (ITC Holdings) and certain of its         subsidiaries5 (together, the ITC Applicants) (Entergy-ITC Transaction) and to effectuate         the integration of the Entergy Applicants’ transmission facilities into the Midwest         Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO).6 In this order, we grant in         part, deny in part, and dismiss in part the requests for rehearing, institute an FPA section         206 proceeding in Docket No. EL14-19-000, establish a refund effective date, establish         hearing and settlement judge procedures, consolidate certain proceedings, and terminate         certain proceedings, as discussed below.                 1                   16 U.S.C. § 824d (2012).                 2                   18 C.F.R.

Background         2.      In April 2011, Entergy announced its intention to join MISO as a Transmission         Owner effective December 19, 2013, subject to receiving the necessary regulatory         approvals. Eight months later, while MISO was taking preparatory steps towards         integrating Entergy into MISO, Entergy and ITC Holdings announced their proposal to         separate Entergy’s jurisdictional transmission facilities into six separate “wires-only”         transmission subsidiaries of Entergy Mid South, a newly-formed subsidiary holding         company of Entergy, to spin-off the ownership interests of Entergy Mid South to         Entergy’s shareholders, and then to merge Entergy Mid South with ITC Midsouth, a         newly-formed subsidiary holding company of ITC Holdings.7 In order to meet both of         these goals, the proposed integration of Entergy into MISO and the transfer of Entergy’s         transmission facilities to ITC Holdings through the proposed merger, Entergy, ITC         Holdings, and MISO devised a “phased approach.”8         3.      The first phase of this process involved several Commission filings by MISO, ITC         Holdings and Entergy to effectuate the transfer of Entergy’s transmission assets to the         four new operating companies that will hold the Entergy transmission facilities after the         Entergy-ITC Transaction closes (the New ITC Operating Companies)9 and MISO’s         provision of transmission service on these facilities during the time after the Entergy-ITC         Transaction closes and before integration of the generation and load within Entergy’s         footprint into MISO’s energy and operating reserves markets.         4.      In Docket No. ER12-2681-000, the ITC Applicants and the Entergy Applicants         (collectively, Rates Applicants) filed tariff revisions as part of a Joint Application for         Authorization of Acquisition and Disposition of Jurisdictional Transmission Facilities,         Approval of Transmission Service Formula Rate and Certain Jurisdictional Agreements,         and Petition for Declaratory Order on Application of section 305(a) of the Federal Power         Act (Rates Application).10 The ITC Applicants sought approval pursuant to FPA                 7                   Joint Application at 2.                 8                   Id.                 9                   The New ITC Operating Companies are: ITC Arkansas LLC (ITC Arkansas),         ITC Texas, LLC (ITC Texas), ITC Louisiana LLC (ITC Louisiana) and ITC Mississippi         LLC (ITC Mississippi).                 10                    Joint Application for Authorization of Acquisition and Disposition of         Jurisdictional Transmission Facilities, Approval of Transmission Service Formula Rate         and Certain Jurisdictional Agreements, and Petition for Declaratory Order on Application         of section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, Docket Nos.

Rates Applicants stated that the         proposed rate construct is integral to the Entergy-ITC Transaction, and that the proposed         formula rate, rate schedules and jurisdictional agreements included in the Rates         Application will provide the Commission with a “complete picture” of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction.12         5.       On February 11, 2013, in Docket No. ER13-948-000, MISO and Entergy         Services, Inc. (Entergy Services), on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, filed         company-specific Attachment O formula rate templates to the MISO Tariff for each of         the Entergy Operating Companies that included a proposal for transmission pricing zones         (TPZ) (TPZ Filing).13 These formula rate templates are referred to as the Entergy         Operating Companies MISO Attachment O formula rates in this order. The Entergy         Operating Companies stated that the rates proposed in the TPZ Filing would be used in         the event that the Entergy-ITC Transaction fails to close and Entergy retains its         transmission assets. The Entergy Operating Companies explained that if the Entergy-ITC         Transaction does close, these rates will be used by the New ITC Operating Companies to         bill for transmission service during the interim period from the date that the Entergy-ITC         Transaction closes to the date that the Entergy transmission system is fully integrated into         MISO, which is expected to occur December 19, 2013, subject to true-up.

On January 18, 2013, in Docket No. ER13-782-000, the New ITC Operating         Companies proposed accounting and ratemaking treatment for certain pension and post-         retirement welfare (OPEB) plan costs that relate to the approximately 750 employees of         Entergy that will become ITC Holdings employees as part of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction (OPEB Filing).14         7.      On June 20, 2013, in the Rates Order, which addressed the Rates Application,         OPEB Filing and TPZ Filing,15 the Commission summarily resolved certain issues         including, as relevant to this order, return on equity (ROE), TPZ Filing and parallel loop         flows issues. The Commission set other aspects of the proposed rates for the New ITC         Operating Companies and the Entergy Operating Companies for hearing and settlement         judge procedures.         8.      On September 24, 2012, Entergy made the Ancillary Services Filing,16 which         proposed Tariff provisions for generation-based ancillary services, generator imbalance         service, and generator regulation service. On June 20, 2013, in the Ancillary Services         Order, the Commission accepted the Ancillary Services Filing.         9.      On September 24, 2012, MISO filed the Module B-1 Filing,17 which proposed a         new and temporary section to be added to its Tariff for the purpose of providing         transmission service over transmission lines that Entergy was planning to sell to ITC         Holdings. Module B-1 set forth the terms and conditions of service over the Entergy         transmission facilities for the six month interim period between the time Entergy’s         transmission facilities were to be transferred to ITC, until Entergy integrated with MISO.         On June 20, 2013, in the Module B-1 Order, the Commission accepted the Module B-1         Filing, subject to compliance filings.                 14                    New ITC Operating Companies, Accounting and Ratemaking Treatment for         Pension and OPEB Costs, Docket No. ER13-782-000 (filed Jan. 18, 2013).                 15                    Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257.                 16                    Entergy Services, Inc.

Service Schedule MSS-2 concerns transmission equalization under the Entergy System         Agreement. The System Agreement is a Commission-approved tariff that currently         requires the generation and transmission facilities of the Entergy Operating Companies’         (except Entergy Arkansas) to be operated as a single integrated operating system.                19                   Separate requests for authorizations under FPA section 204 to facilitate the         Entergy-ITC Transaction were filed in Docket Nos.

Further, because the         Entergy-ITC Transaction did not occur, the requests for rehearing and clarification in         Docket Nos. ER12-2681-001, ER13-782-001, and ER12-2683-001 are dismissed as         moot.                 24                    These filings were also made in the Module B-1 proceeding in Docket         No. ER12-2682-002. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                               - 10 -         19.     Accordingly, the only issues remaining on rehearing are those raised in Docket         No. ER13-948-001 that are applicable to the Entergy Operating Companies, which are         summarized and discussed below. We will grant in part and deny in part these requests         for rehearing. Further, as discussed below, we institute an FPA section 206 proceeding in         Docket No. EL14-19-000, establish a refund effective date, establish hearing and         settlement judge procedures, and consolidate Docket No. EL14-19-000 with the ongoing         proceedings in Docket No. ER13-948-000 for purposes of settlement, hearing and         decision.                 B.      Substantive Matters                         1.     Return on Equity                                a.    Rates Order         20.     In the Rates Order, the Commission found that it was consistent with Commission         precedent for the Entergy Operating Companies to use the then-current ROE that has         been approved for use by all MISO Transmission Owners if they become members of         MISO. The Commission explained that it has previously approved a single base ROE for         transmission-owning members of MISO, and has found that “[t]ransmission-owning         members of MISO are currently authorized to use a 12.38 percent ROE for calculating         their annual transmission revenue requirement.”25 The Commission found that         notwithstanding the alternative discounted cash flow analysis and other evidence         protestors submitted to challenge the MISO ROE, protestors had not demonstrated why         the Entergy Operating Companies should not be entitled to the same treatment as all other         transmission-owning members of MISO.26                                b.    Request for Rehearing         21.     Joint Customers argue on rehearing that they supported their position that the         12.38 percent ROE should not be approved for the Entergy Operating Companies with         substantial, reliable evidence. They point to the affidavit and supporting materials         prepared by an expert witness that provided a cost of common equity analysis for the         Entergy transmission assets that tracks the methodology applied to establish the         12.38 percent MISO ROE in 2002. Joint Customers contend that the results of this         analysis showed that the median value for a just and reasonable ROE for a single                 25                    Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 61 (quoting DATC Midwest Holdings,         LLC, 139 FERC ¶ 61,224, at P 83 (2012)).                 26                    Id. PP 60-61. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                    - 11 -         company was 8.85 percent and 8.91 percent for a group of companies. Thus, Joint         Customers maintain that they provided analysis using the Commission’s methodology         that the ROE sought for the Entergy Operating Companies exceeds a just and reasonable         return by at least 347 basis points. They contend that neither the Entergy Operating         Companies nor any other participant presented any countervailing evidence that the         requested 12.38 percent ROE is just and reasonable. Joint Customers assert that the         Rates Order summarizes portions of the affidavits and exhibits but does not consider the         method or findings and does not use the evidence in setting forth the basis for the         determination.27 The Louisiana Commission points out on rehearing that the decline in         corporate bond yields between 2002 and the current time period, as well as the capital         cost estimates for fully integrated electric utilities in its own witness testimony,         demonstrate a decline in bond yields, which indicate a cost of capital that is well below         the return on equity requested by Applicants. It also asserts that the risk for common         equity capital under a formula rate construct at the Commission is substantially less than         the risk that exists generally with publicly-traded electric utilities subject to traditional         rate-base, rate-of-return regulation.28         22.     Joint Customers likewise challenge the Commission’s finding that the Entergy         Operating Companies are “entitled” to the MISO ROE. They assert that the FPA does         not vest in the Entergy Operating Companies an enforceable legal right to collect any set         of rates or charges other than those that have been proven to be just, reasonable, and not         unduly discriminatory or preferential for them. Joint Customers argue that the automatic         grant of a 12.38 percent ROE without any analysis of those entities’ actual costs of         common equity does not comport with the Commission’s duty under the FPA to establish         just and reasonable rates based on the facts and circumstances of each section 205 filing         as presented in the evidence of record.29         23.     Joint Customers also assert that they should not bear the burden of demonstrating         that Applicants are not entitled to a 12.38 percent ROE. They contend that the         Commission’s finding that Applicants are entitled to the requested ROE shifts the burden         on them even though they demonstrated that applying the 12.38 percent ROE to the         Entergy transmission assets would produce unjust and unreasonable charges for service.                 27                    Joint Customers Request for Rehearing at 6-9.                 28                    Louisiana Commission Request for Rehearing at 5-7.                 29                    Joint Customers Request for Rehearing at 10-12. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 12 -         As such, Joint Customers maintain that, at minimum, this issue should have been set for         hearing.30         24.     Additionally, Joint Customers take issue with the Commission’s position that the         only remedy for the ROE issue is under FPA section 206. They assert that because this         proceeding involves applications under FPA section 205, Applicants bear the burden of         showing that their proposal will result in just and reasonable rates and that there is no         basis for the Commission’s finding that if protestors believe 12.38 percent is         unreasonable in the context of these section 205 applications, their only remedy is to         challenge the MISO ROE itself. Joint Customers maintain that the course of action         described in the Rates Order would require protestors to litigate against all existing MISO         transmission owners and that there is no basis in law for relegating protestors to a         section 206 remedy in these circumstances. They contend that the Rates Order deprives         Entergy’s customers of the protection under FPA section 205 concerning the ROE to be         applied to their service.31                                c.    Commission Determination         25.     We affirm the Commission’s finding in the Rates Order that the Entergy Operating         Companies may use the then-current ROE that has been approved for use by all MISO         Transmission Owners upon integration with MISO and therefore we deny rehearing on         this issue. As the Commission stated in the Rates Order, approving the use of the MISO         ROE by the Entergy Operating Companies is consistent with Commission precedent that         new members of MISO are entitled to use the then-current ROE that has been approved         for use by all MISO Transmission Owners. While parties on rehearing continue to         challenge the just and reasonableness of the MISO ROE, this is not the proper proceeding         to raise such issues. As the Commission stated in the Rates Order, if parties wish to         change the MISO ROE, they must file a separate FPA section 206 complaint. We note         that a complaint filed by multiple MISO customers regarding the MISO base ROE is now         pending before the Commission in Docket No. EL14-12-000. Challenges to the MISO         ROE will be addressed in that proceeding.                 30                    Id. at 13-14.                 31                    Id. at 14-16. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 13 -                         2.     Transmission Pricing Zones                                a.     Rates Order         26.     In the Rates Order, the Commission accepted the Entergy Operating Companies’         proposal for four transmission pricing zones and ITC Holdings’ proposal to adopt the         zones approved for the Entergy Operating Companies. The Commission stated that its         acceptance was based on the fact that the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies         into MISO will significantly alter the way service over Entergy’s transmission assets as         MISO will be the entity administering transmission service over Entergy’s transmission         system. Thus, the Commission found the proposal consistent with the use of license plate         pricing in MISO.32         27.     The Commission explained that the Entergy Operating Companies have provided         transmission service at a single system average rate under the Entergy OATT, and that         upon the Entergy Operating Companies’ proposed integration into MISO, service will be         provided on a regional basis over the entire MISO system and priced using MISO’s         license plate zonal rate design. The Commission further stated that under the license         plate zonal rate design, customers pay a single non-pancaked rate based on the cost of         existing facilities and new local facilities in their pricing zone, plus the cost of new         regional facilities allocated to that zone or shared regionally, and have access to the entire         MISO system. The Commission stated that this change in the way service is provided         and priced over Entergy’s transmission system supports the use of multiple transmission         pricing zones, which allows Entergy to adopt the current zonal structure in MISO.         28.     The Commission acknowledged on-going negotiations with respect to         transmission pricing zones, but determined that only the Entergy Operating Companies’         transmission pricing zone proposal was before it. However, the Commission stated that         its acceptance of the Entergy Operating Companies’ transmission pricing zone proposal         was without prejudice to Entergy making an additional filing seeking to establish a fifth         zone for the Entergy New Orleans service territory.33                                b.     Request for Rehearing         29.     The City of New Orleans takes issue with the Commission’s approval of the         Louisiana-wide transmission pricing zone proposal. The City of New Orleans contends         that this determination was inexplicable because the Commission stated that it agreed                 32                    Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 122.                 33                    Id. P 127. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 14 -         with the City of New Orleans’ arguments in support of a separate transmission pricing         zone for Entergy New Orleans, but nevertheless stated that the Entergy New Orleans         transmission pricing zone was not before the Commission. The City of New Orleans         contends that the issue was before the Commission because it protested Entergy’s         proposal to force Entergy New Orleans into a single Louisiana-wide transmission pricing         zone in several pleadings. It asserts that neither Entergy nor any other party offered         evidence regarding why Entergy New Orleans must be part of a Louisiana-wide         transmission pricing zone, and that the City of New Orleans never agreed that this issue         should wait pending negotiations with the Louisiana Commission. The City of New         Orleans asserts that if the Commission’s decision relies on negotiations with the         Louisiana Commission, that reliance is misplaced because the Louisiana Commission has         no intention of agreeing to a single transmission prizing zone for Entergy New Orleans.34         30.      The City of New Orleans argues that it presented evidence that supports an         Entergy New Orleans transmission pricing zone and that no other party rebutted any of         this evidence. It cites its arguments that requiring Entergy New Orleans to be part of a         Louisiana-wide transmission pricing zone is inconsistent with Commission precedent and         MISO practices, is unduly discriminatory and preferential because it will drastically         increase Entergy New Orleans’ transmission rates, and will permanently shift costs from         the Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana systems to Entergy New         Orleans’ retail ratepayers. As such, the City of New Orleans maintains that the         Commission erred in relying on Entergy’s statements regarding negotiations over the         transmission pricing zone issue between the parties rather than ruling on the evidence         before it, and that the Commission should have ordered Entergy to make a filing for an         Entergy New Orleans transmission pricing zone.35         31.      Additionally, the City of New Orleans contends that Entergy’s unilateral statement         that it is engaging in negotiations would not remove the transmission pricing zone issue         from controversy before the Commission and does not take away the Commission’s         authority to rule on an issue on the merits.36 It asserts that the tariff provisions are         discriminatory because they treat Entergy New Orleans differently, without cause, than         the Entergy Operating Companies in Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and Cleco in         Louisiana. The City of New Orleans further argues that forcing Entergy New Orleans         into a Louisiana-wide transmission pricing zone will unreasonably increase Entergy New                  34                     The City of New Orleans Request for Rehearing at 20.                  35                     Id. at 21-22.                  36                     Id. at 23. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 15 -         Orleans customer costs and subjugate the City of New Orleans’ jurisdiction over Entergy         New Orleans to the Louisiana Commission.37         32.     The City of New Orleans points to the Louisiana Commission’s order on Cleco’s         application to join MISO and the Louisiana Commission’s comments in the Rates Order         proceeding as rationale for including Entergy New Orleans’ transmission assets in an         Entergy New Orleans transmission pricing zone. It asserts that in the Louisiana         Commission proceeding, the Louisiana Commission’s witness testimony explained that a         single Cleco transmission pricing zone would be beneficial to its customers because they         would pay only for transmission facilities owned by Cleco and not for Entergy         Louisiana’s transmission facilities. The City of New Orleans further asserts that         additional Louisiana Commission witness testimony in that proceeding explained that         including Cleco-owned transmission assets in the Louisiana-wide transmission pricing         zone would harm Cleco’s customers. In the order approving Cleco’s membership in         MISO, the Louisiana Commission required that all of Cleco’s transmission assets be         included in a Cleco-only transmission pricing zone. The City of New Orleans points out         that despite the Louisiana Commission’s approval of the Cleco transmission pricing zone,         it refused to support a similar transmission pricing zone for Entergy New Orleans. It         argues that there is no material difference between Entergy New Orleans and any other         operating company, affiliated or not with Entergy that justifies the discriminatory         treatment. Specifically, the City of New Orleans states that Entergy New Orleans,         Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas and Cleco are each (1) a separate         company; (2) a load serving entity; and (3) a transmission owner that owns its own         transmission assets. Additionally, the City of New Orleans contends that each operating         company is interconnected with, and to some extent uses the transmission systems of the         other operating companies. Thus, the City of New Orleans maintains that there is no         minimum transmission system size requirement or load requirement for a transmission         pricing zone.38         33.     The City of New Orleans also argues that including Entergy New Orleans         transmission assets in a Louisiana transmission pricing zone obligates Entergy New         Orleans’ rate payers to pay a share of the cost of every transmission project authorized by         the Louisiana Commission for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana         whether or not they benefit from the project. It asserts that this prevents the City of New         Orleans from protecting Entergy New Orleans ratepayers against unjust and unreasonable         increases in cost, particularly where no commensurate benefit is provided. Additionally,         the City of New Orleans points out that the Louisiana Commission has no jurisdictional                 37                    Id. at 24.                 38                    Id. at 27-28. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                    - 16 -         obligation to approve construction or siting of transmission facilities intended to benefit         Entergy New Orleans’ rate payers.39         34.     The City of New Orleans further asserts that Entergy New Orleans retail         ratepayers will be required to pay a load ratio share of Entergy Louisiana’s and Entergy         Gulf States Louisiana’s current and future transmission facilities irrespective of voltage         level, which subsidizes costs beyond what the Entergy System Agreement currently         requires. It explains that under the Entergy System Agreement, each Entergy Operating         Company recovers the cost of providing retail service on its own transmission system         from its own retail customers. In addition to these costs, under Service Schedule MSS-2         of the Entergy System Agreement, each Entergy Operating Company contributes to or         receives a share of the cost of Entergy system-wide transmission assets at voltages at and         above 230 kV based on the theory that all Entergy Operating Companies benefit from         facilities at voltages at and above 230 kV. The City of New Orleans states that when an         Entergy Operating Company exits the Entergy System Agreement, its obligations under         Service Schedule MSS-2 terminates. Additionally, if the Entergy-ITC Transaction         closes, then Service Schedule MSS-2 also terminates. However, the City of New Orleans         states that under the TPZ proposal, Entergy New Orleans ratepayers will have to continue         subsidizing Entergy Louisiana’s and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s transmission         systems irrespective of whether the Entergy-ITC Transaction closes. 40 The City of         New Orleans contends that if Entergy New Orleans is forced into a Louisiana         transmission pricing zone it will forever be required to subsidize Entergy Louisiana’s and         Entergy Gulf States’ transmission costs.41         35.     Joint Customers take issue with the Commission’s acceptance of the four         transmission pricing zones, arguing that Entergy should continue to use its single-system         wide rate. They contend that the Commission’s focus on anticipated future operation and         administration is in error because it loses sight of the fact that it fundamentally alters the         pricing for Entergy’s pre-existing set of transmission assets. Additionally, they argue that         for the pricing of such assets to be just and reasonable, that pricing must also be         consistent with the Commission’s cost causation principle. Joint Customers assert that         because the existing facilities were planned and built to serve the needs of all customers         in the entire four state area served by the Entergy transmission system on a least cost         basis without regard to state lines, only the continuation of single-system pricing for these         historical facilities is based on cost incurrence, and therefore, this is the only just and                 39                    Id. at 28.                 40                    Id. at 29-30.                 41                    Id. at 31. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 17 -         reasonable pricing method. Joint Customers also maintain that it is error to equate what         is possible under the MISO Tariff with what is permissible under Commission precedent         and principles. They assert that the history of system-wide planning and pricing dictates         adherence to a single pricing zone methodology to avoid violating long-standing         Commission policy. Also, Joint Customers state that neither Entergy nor ITC Holdings         has suggested that the Entergy transmission facilities will be operated in a non-integrated         manner. Thus, Joint Customers maintain that neither the transfer of ownership of         transmission facilities from the Entergy Operating Companies to the New ITC Operating         Companies, nor the transfer of operational control of those facilities to MISO,         necessitates abandonment of the long-standing, single pricing zone methodology.42 Joint         Customers further argue that the four-zone pricing approach would abrogate the sharing         of costs for facilities that were caused by needs of the entire system and that some zones         will be charged for existing facilities that were designed to benefit the entire system,         while others will obtain a relative “free-ride” by receiving the benefits from facilities they         previously caused to be built.43 Joint Customers contend that under the Rates         Application, only the previously irrelevant state lines will determine who pays for the         historical facilities, which violates that cost causation principle. Joint Customers argue         that ministerial changes in the way service is provided as part of the transfer of         operational control do not require the abandonment of system-wide pricing for such         historical assets.         36.     With respect to Commission precedent, Joint Customers assert that Entergy, ITC         Holdings, the Arkansas Commission and City of New Orleans failed to demonstrate that         any precedent they cite involved a group of affiliated operating companies whose         transmission was planned, operated, coordinated, and priced on an integrated basis that         were allowed to use multiple, disparate pricing zones solely because they joined an         Independent System Operator (ISO) or Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).         Joint Customers contend that only they presented a case with comparable circumstances         where a company with integrated affiliates attempted to use multiple pricing zones with         differing rates. They point to a case involving PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), the         PJM Zonal Rate Case,44 in which the Commission rejected multiple pricing zones even         though those companies previously had charged separate transmission rates.

However, Joint Customers maintain that in this case, the Commission relied on the City         of New Orleans’ assertion that this and other cases cited by Joint Customers are no longer         applicable because of the evolving nature of ISO/RTOs and because the opinions were         issued prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA).         Joint Customers maintain that neither the portion of Order No. 888 relied on by City of         New Orleans in making its argument nor the PJM Zonal Rate Order purports to rely on         PUHCA in making the determination that a single-system rate should be used for         affiliated systems. They point to Commission orders issued after the repeal of PUHCA         that explicitly relied on Order No. 888’s requirement that certain public utility holding         companies file single-system rates.45         37.     Joint Customers further argue that the Commission’s conclusion in the Rates         Order that upon integration of the transmission assets in MISO, service will be provided         on a regional basis over the entire MISO system and priced using MISO’s license plate         zonal design, does not reference any assertion by Entergy, ITC Holdings or others, or any         portion of the MISO Tariff, or any evidence to support a finding that the four-zone         pricing proposal is necessitated by or is more consistent with license plate pricing than         continuation of the historical single zone.46 Joint Customers contend that the         Commission’s finding that joining an ISO/RTO that has received approval to implement         license plate pricing allows Entergy to abandon system-wide pricing of existing facilities         in favor of a four-zone structure makes the inappropriate leap to presuming that a four-         zone approach would be superior to a single zone, or would not violate Commission         precedent and principles. They point out that no party in this proceeding has provided         any evidence for the Commission to conclude that a single zone would be antithetical to         the license plate zonal rate design of MISO. Joint Customers argue that only the use of a         single-system zone is just and reasonable and consistent with cost causation as applied to         Entergy’s existing transmission system because only the single-system zone is based on         an allocation of costs to the loads that caused the costs at issue.47         38.     Joint Customers also request rehearing of the Commission’s findings related to         storm recovery settlement requirements. They argue that the Commission dismissed their         concerns by observing that the Entergy Operating Companies have pledged to recover         these costs in the zone where the storms occurred. However, Joint Customers maintain         that the record does not support this assertion and that Entergy has not provided a clear                 45                    Joint Customers Request for Rehearing at 39-40.                 46                    Id. at 40.                 47                    Id. at 40-41. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 19 -         statement that this will be accomplished under the four pricing zone construct.         Additionally, Joint Customers assert that the Commission did not cite an adequate         explanation from Entergy as to how this will be accomplished. They assert that without a         specific requirement and a detailed explanation for how Entergy will limit recovery of         such storm costs to the zone in which the storms occurred, there is no assurance that the         storm cost securitization settlement obligations will be implemented in the manner relied         upon by the Commission.48         39.     Joint Customers point out that the Commission noted that the Arkansas and         Mississippi Commissions have made separate pricing zones conditions for allowing         Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to transfer functional control of their         transmission facilities to MISO, and argue that the Commission is not bound by the         determinations of state commissions. Additionally, they assert that state commission         rulings do not relieve the Commission of its obligation to ensure just and reasonable         rates.49                                c.      Commission Determination         40.     We deny Joint Customers’ and the City of New Orleans’ requests for rehearing of         the Commission’s finding that that a proposal for a four zone configuration was not         properly before the Commission. In the Rates Order, the Commission ruled on the         proposal before it (i.e., the four zones) and whether that proposal was just and reasonable.         Joint Customers and the City of New Orleans make arguments for a different zonal         configuration than what was filed by Entergy; the Commission’s statutory burden,         however, under section 205 of the FPA, was to determine whether Entergy’s proposal         was just and reasonable. While other configurations could exist, and there may be         compelling arguments for such configurations, the Commission ruled on the proposal         before it and the facts surrounding that proposal.50 We affirm our finding in the Rates         Order that the four transmission pricing zones are just and reasonable.                 48                    Id. at 41-42.                 49                    Id. at 42.                 50                    See ISO New England, Inc., 138 FERC ¶ 61,042, at P 84 n.97 (2012) (“Faced         with competing proposals, the Commission may approve a proposal as just and         reasonable; it need not be the only reasonable proposal or even the most accurate.”); ISO         New England, Inc., 138 FERC ¶ 61,027, at P 75 n.109 (2012); Oxy USA, Inc. v.

Cir. 1995) (finding that under the FPA, as long as the         Commission finds a methodology to be just and reasonable, that methodology “need not         be the only reasonable methodology, or even the most accurate one.”). 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 20 -         41.    As the Commission explained in the Rates Order, Entergy is proposing to establish         transmission pricing zones for its transmission system, which is consistent with the         implementation of license plate pricing in MISO.51 The way that service is provided on         the Entergy transmission system changed fundamentally, with MISO becoming the         transmission provider and service being provided under a regional tariff with a license         plate zonal rate design, on December 19, 2013 upon Entergy’s integration into MISO.         Under the license plate zonal rate design, customers pay a single non-pancaked rate based         on the cost of existing facilities and new local facilities in their pricing zone, plus the cost         of new regional facilities allocated to that zone or shared regionally, and have access to         the entire MISO system. This change in the way service is provided and priced over         Entergy’s transmission system supports the use of multiple transmission pricing zones,         which allows Entergy to adopt the current zonal structure in MISO. Joint Customers,         however, cite to precedent that requires a single rate among interconnected, affiliated         transmission systems in support of their claims for a single rate across the Entergy         transmission system.52 The precedent, however, was established at the inception of the         Commission’s approval of, and MISO and PJM’s implementation of, license plate         pricing, before the Commission gained experience with implementation of license plate         pricing in PJM and other ISOs and RTOs. Since that time, the Commission has become         more flexible with respect to license plate pricing, as the Commission has not only         accepted the continued use of license plate pricing for existing and new local facilities on         a long-term basis, but the Commission has also accepted reconfigurations of license plate         pricing zones that deviate from historical configurations.53         42.    Moreover, the City of New Orleans’ protest on this issue does not bring a proposal         for a new transmission pricing zone before the Commission. The Commission’s basis for         approving four transmission pricing zones was based not on the status of negotiations                51                   See Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys. Operator, Inc., 122 FERC ¶ 61,081         (2008).                52                   See, e.g., Entergy Services, Inc., 58 FERC ¶ 61,234, at 61,769 (1992); Southern         Co.

As mentioned above, just as it is         possible for there to be more than one just and reasonable methodology, there can be         several possible zonal configurations that would comply with the implementation of         license plate pricing in MISO. What was filed before the Commission was a proposal to         create four transmission pricing zones and, should a fifth transmission pricing zone be         proposed by Entergy, the Commission will consider such proposal at that time.         Additionally, we disagree with the City of New Orleans’ argument that the Rates Order         subjugates its jurisdiction. The zonal rate design is subject to the Commission’s         jurisdiction and MISO conducts its transmission planning under a Commission-approved         process, the MISO Transmission Expansion Plan (MTEP).54 The MTEP is an open and         transparent, stakeholder-driven process by which MISO annually identifies transmission         projects required to address system needs and produces an annual MTEP report.55         43.     Furthermore, we recognize the concerns raised by the City of New Orleans but         note that those concerns have been rendered moot by the cancellation of the Entergy-ITC         Transaction. Specifically, the City of New Orleans expresses concern that the Entergy         New Orleans retail customers would be forced to subsidize the costs of the transmission         systems of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. However, because the         transaction will not occur, Service Schedule MSS-2 and the exemption for bundled load56         will still apply, and the Entergy New Orleans retail customers will be shielded from the         concerns raised by the City of New Orleans. This arrangement is reflected in the Joint         Pricing Zone Revenue Allocation Agreement between Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf         States Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans whereby the three operating companies share         transmission revenues.57 The Joint Pricing Zone Revenue Allocation Agreement         specifies the application of the exemption for bundled load as long as Service Schedule         MSS-2, or some alternative arrangement for allocating transmission costs among the         parties, is in effect and provides that the only revenues allocated under the agreement will         be wholesale transmission service revenues (i.e., no revenues or costs associated with         service to the parties’ bundled retail load will be reallocated under the agreement).                 54                    See, e.g., Otter Tail Power Co., 137 FERC ¶ 61,255 (2011).                 55                    Id. P 3.                 56                    Under the MISO Tariff, certain transmission customers that are also         transmission owners are exempt from the obligation to pay the license plate zonal rates         under Schedule 9 of the MISO Tariff for transmission service used to serve bundled load.                 57                    Entergy Services, Inc., 145 FERC ¶ 61,246 (2013). 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 22 -         Additionally, nothing in this order affects the City of New Orleans’ jurisdiction over         Entergy New Orleans.         44.    Finally, in response to Joint Customers’ concern that establishing four         transmission pricing zones will frustrate the previous allocation of securitized storm         restoration costs, we note that, in Docket No. ER14-649-000, Entergy filed a proposed         Schedule 41 to the MISO Tariff that will provide “for the recovery of the storm         securitization charges consistent with settlement agreements approved by FERC in 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 23 -         Docket Nos. ER10-984 and ER11-3274.”58 Entergy’s commitment to maintain the         previous allocation of securitized storm costs is addressed by that filing which is pending         before the Commission.                        3.     Parallel Loop Flows                               a.     Rates Order         45.     In the Rates Order, the Commission noted parties’ concern about the sufficiency         of existing agreements that were in place to handle power flows as a result of Entergy’s         integration, and also noted ongoing negotiations over potential modifications to these         agreements. The Commission encouraged parties to continue to work together to resolve         these issues and noted its interest in the status of those negotiations.         46.     The Commission distinguished arguments relying on Commonwealth Edison as         support for requiring Applicants to hold parties harmless from potential parallel loop         flows. The Commission explained that the hold harmless remedy established in         Commonwealth Edison for utilities in Wisconsin and Michigan was developed to mitigate         the geographic separation of utilities in those two states resulting from Commonwealth         Edison and American Electric Power’s decisions to join PJM. Thus, the Commission         found that the hold harmless remedy was not established to address loop flow or parallel         flow issues per se, but rather geographic separation of certain utilities from the rest of         their RTO, a situation that does not exist here.         47.     The Commission further noted that, at the time of the Commonwealth Edison         proceeding, the present day RTOs were just forming and had not established         arrangements to coordinate the flows on neighboring transmission systems. However,         the Commission stated that RTOs have since developed joint operating agreements with         mechanisms such as the Congestion Management Process to coordinate parallel flows.         The Commission pointed out that this process is included in the MISO-SPP JOA and the         MISO-PJM JOA.59         48.     Additionally, the Commission addressed arguments concerning loop flows over         the SPP transmission system by noting the ongoing renegotiation of the MISO-SPP JOA                 58                    Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., MISO eTariff, Schedule 41,         Charge to Recover Costs of Entergy Storm Securitization (§ 31.0.0).                 59                    Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 149. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 24 -         as required by the Commission in the MISO-SPP JOA Order,60 and that SPP was         required to file a phase 2 MISO-SPP JOA by June 30, 2013. The Commission noted that         interested parties will be free to challenge the terms of the revised MISO-SPP JOA when         it is filed with the Commission and that if MISO and SPP fail to reach an agreement, they         may petition the Commission for modifications to their JOA.61                                b.     Request for Rehearing         49.      TVA, SPP and SPP Transmission Owners request rehearing of the Commission’s         findings regarding loop flows. TVA and SPP take issue with the Commission’s finding         that the hold harmless remedy in Commonwealth Edison does not apply in this case based         on geographic considerations. TVA requests rehearing of the Commission’s         determination that concerns regarding loop flows should be resolved in the context of         new or modified JOAs between MISO and the neighboring entities. It asserts that in         reaching the conclusion that the geographical separation of certain utilities in the         Commonwealth Edison case does not exist in this proceeding, the Commission         misunderstood the factual situation presented by the Entergy integration or failed to         adhere to its own precedent. TVA contends that no MISO transmission owner is located         physically adjacent to Entergy, but rather, Entergy is geographically separated from the         remainder of the MISO footprint. It points out that interspersed between the MISO         footprint and the Entergy service area are Associated Electric Cooperative (to Entergy’s         north), TVA (to Entergy’s east/northeast), and SPP (to Entergy’s west/northwest). SPP         asserts that the hold harmless protection described in Commonwealth Edison has never         been qualified as a function of geographic separation, but rather is intended to address a         wide range of financial impacts resulting from operational consequences of a utility         joining or exiting an RTO, including protection against congestion uplift, locational price         increases, changes in levels and/or frequency of transmission loading relief procedures,         and any other significant commercial impacts that can be reasonably identified and         quantified. Additionally, SPP maintains that the Commission did not explain the         rationale or relevance of its geographic separation distinction. Nevertheless, SPP         contends that the geography distinction the Commission attempts to draw is a distinction         without a difference because Entergy and MISO are geographically separated, and this         separation causes harmful flows on the SPP system.62 Thus, TVA and SPP maintain that                  60                     Midwest Indep.Tranmission Sys. Operator, Inc., 136 FERC ¶ 61,010 (2011)         (MISO-SPP JOA Order), reh’g denied, 138 FERC ¶ 61,055 (2012).                  61                     Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at.

Accordingly, TVA requests that the Commission grant rehearing and apply         Commonwealth Edison, and direct MISO and Entergy to hold TVA and SPP harmless         from any adverse effects from loop flows resulting from the integration of Entergy into         the MISO footprint until a modified or new JOA is executed.63         50.     SPP argues that the Commission granted the requested tariff approvals without         confronting the specific and well-supported challenges raised by SPP and others, and         directs those parties to pursue negotiations, and as necessary, file a complaint under FPA         section 206 if unsatisfied with the outcome. It contends that this result defies reasoned         decision-making and stands the burden of proof requirements under FPA sections 205         and 206 on their head. Additionally, SPP argues that the Commission provided no         substantive response to SPP’s concerns about the proposed integration of Entergy into         MISO, which SPP contends it filed in reliance on the directive in the SPP JOA Order         where the Commission stated that loop flow issues would be raised and addressed in         filings required to implement any decision by Entergy Arkansas to join MISO. SPP         maintains that its comment identified specific adverse impacts from the Entergy-MISO         integration such as uncompensated uses of SPP’s transmission capacity and increased         congestion on SPP’s system. It asserts that the Commission presumes away these         concerns by suggesting they can be resolved in ongoing JOA negotiations. However,         SPP contends that parties’ renegotiation of the JOA does not relieve the Commission of         its FPA section 205 responsibility to examine issues going to the justness and         reasonableness of the tariff changes proposed by MISO and Entergy. SPP further argues         that MISO and Entergy have never obtained Commission approval of their use of SPP’s         transmission system to integrate all of the Entergy Operating Companies. It maintains         that these concerns raise serious questions as to whether the tariff mechanisms proposed         to implement the Entergy-MISO integration are just and reasonable under FPA         section 205 and it is insufficient for the Commission to demur to ongoing negotiations         and require MISO to submit an informational report on the status of renegotiations of the         JOA.64         51.     SPP further takes issue with the Commission’s statement that if SPP and MISO         are unable to agree on revisions to the MISO-SPP JOA to address SPP’s parallel flow         concerns, then SPP may file a complaint under FPA section 206. It contends that the         Commission must consider SPP’s challenges as part of the Commission’s FPA         section 205 deliberations and that SPP should not bear the burden of proof under a new                 63                    TVA Request for Rehearing at 2-3.                 64                    SPP Request for Rehearing at 9-13. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 26 -         FPA section 206 complaint. SPP asserts that the Commission should grant rehearing and         initiate fact finding proceedings that will permit SPP’s system use and compensation         issues to be properly investigated.65         52.     SPP Transmission Owners argue that SPP has stated in pleadings before the         Commission that revisions that it has filed to the MISO-SPP JOA do not address the         issues in these proceedings.66 Additionally, they contend that the status report required         by the Rates Order does not address the integration issues raised, provide guidance or         establish any process or procedures for the parties to follow in renegotiating the MISO-         SPP JOA. SPP Transmission Owners further assert that based on the limited revisions         achieved for the June 28, 2013 compliance filing, the Commission should not expect         much in the November 2013 status report. However, SPP Transmission Owners state         that the Commission should not wait until the filing of the November 2013 status report         to confirm such concerns, but should establish settlement judge proceedings to allow         interested parties to provide input to the discussions between MISO and SPP regarding         modifications to the JOA. They point to the proceeding regarding the SPP Integrated         Marketplace where the Commission adopted settlement judge proceedings, allowing a         period of eight weeks for negotiations, suggesting that the Commission should adopt the         same approach.67 SPP Transmission Owners also assert that the Commission should         clarify that the additional negotiations required to address integration issues are open to         all interested parties who have expressed concerns on these issues. They contend that         although the MISO-SPP JOA requires MISO and SPP to negotiate in good faith to         address issues raised by either party, it does not preclude MISO or SPP from opening         those discussions to other interested parties.68 SPP Transmission Owners further argue         that the issues under the JOA are complex and that the Commission cannot rely on the         ability of parties to file complaints under section 206 of the FPA to address them.         53.     SPP Transmission Owners further request clarification that the Commission has         not made findings or resolved any issues related to parallel or loop flows, congestion         management or seams issues. They point out instances in the Rates Order where the         Commission noted parties’ requests that MISO be required to protect neighboring         transmission systems from loop flows and the Commission’s response, in which the                 65                    Id. at 13-14.                 66                    SPP Transmission Owners Request for Rehearing at 7-8 & n.11 (citing SPP         Transmission Owners, Compliance Filing, Docket No. ER13-1864-000 (June 28, 2013)).                 67                    Id. at 7-9.                 68                    Id. at 10. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 27 -         Commission noted differences in the orders relied on by those parties from the facts and         circumstances in the proceedings for the Rates Order and the Merger Order. SPP         Transmission Owners further contend that in the Merger Order, the Commission brushed         aside any issues related to the integration of Entergy into MISO by simply stating that         such concerns are not due to the Entergy-ITC Transaction. They request that the         Commission clarify that, in making these various statements related to integration issues,         the Commission was not making any findings regarding the resolution of such issues.         For example, they request that the Commission clarify that, for purposes of the parties’         efforts to renegotiate the MISO-SPP JOA, the Commission has not precluded the use of a         hold harmless provision or similar mechanism to protect transmission owners who will be         adversely impacted by the proposed integration.69         54.     SPP Transmission Owners also seek clarification that the Commission’s statement         that “existing arrangements are in place that address power flows between MISO and         certain neighboring regions,” does not mean that the Commission finds that these existing         arrangements are adequate to address increased loop flows and other dramatic changes         that will result from the Entergy-ITC Transaction.70 They maintain that MISO is not         required under the existing JOA, during time periods when there is no congestion, to limit         the dispatch to the flowgate allocations it receives as a result of the historical use         allocation described in the congestion management process.71         55.     Additionally, SPP Transmission Owners request that the Commission make clear         that its references to Module F of the MISO Tariff are not intended to require that all         congestion management processes must be addressed in Module F, or that the         Commission was making any substantive findings regarding congestion management         issues or the manner in which these issues should be treated in the renegotiated MISO-         SPP JOA. They further request that the Commission clarify that parties are free to raise         any issues of concern in the process of renegotiating or commenting on a revised MISO-         SPP JOA, and that they would not be estopped from raising any issues due to the         Commission’s statements in its orders in these proceedings. SPP Transmission Owners         state that even if the Commission determines not to establish formal procedures for         addressing these issues, and instead relies on the ability of interested parties to protest         any eventual proposed revisions to the MISO-SPP JOA, the Commission should not                 69                    Id. at 12-13.                 70                    Id. at 13 (quoting Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 128).                 71                    Id. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                 - 28 -         further impede the ability of the parties to have their concerns heard by removing issues         or proposed solutions from consideration at this stage.72                                 c.    MISO Informational Report         56.     MISO explains that it continues to discuss loop flow compensation with SPP, and         MISO has indicated that it is open to a loop flow compensation mechanism that is         equitable and reciprocal. MISO states that SPP has provided a specific proposal for         review and the two parties have a meeting scheduled in the near future to discuss SPP’s         proposal. According to MISO, one of the objections that SPP has expressed regarding         the current market-to-non market process, and the proposed market-to-market process, is         that SPP disagrees with MISO’s calculation of market flows. MISO states that, after         several months of discussion in joint stakeholder meetings, MISO has agreed to modify         its market flow calculation methodology and, as a result, MISO and SPP plan to file         additional revisions to the MISO-SPP JOA to change the calculation methodology by the         first quarter of 2014.73         57.     MISO also explains that it has met with SPP stakeholders several times this year to         discuss JOA related matters, such as: market flow calculation methodology; contract         path capacity sharing; joint coordinated system planning; Congestion Management         Process freeze date replacement; and network resource interconnection service. MISO         further explains that the two RTOs have used the joint stakeholder process to identify         initiatives that will reduce the operational and financial impacts of the seam, consistent         with similar Joint and Common Market initiatives previously studied by PJM and MISO         in their Joint and Common Market process. MISO notes that these meetings will         continue beyond the Entergy integration and the implementation of the SPP Integrated         Marketplace, as long as the RTOs and stakeholders believe there are feasible initiatives         worth exploring.74         58.     MISO adds that it negotiated the Operations Reliability Coordination Agreement         (ORCA) with certain neighboring utilities and/or transmission providers, including,         among others, SPP, TVA, and Associated Electric Cooperative. MISO states that the         purpose of the ORCA is to allow for a reasonable transition period to address concerns         raised in connection with the consideration of MISO’s revised Reliability Plan by the         NERC Operating Committee. According to MISO, under the ORCA, MISO will take                 72                    Id. at 14.                 73                    MISO Informational Report at 4.                 74                    Id. at 5. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 29 -         certain actions to limit or control its dispatch based on agreed upon operating limits         without reaching the System Operating Limits on the transmission systems of any of the         parties in real-time for the duration of a certain defined Operations Transition Period,         which will consist of three different phases and will be in effect until April 1, 2015.         MISO finally notes that the ORCA provides that the parties to the ORCA will endeavor         to develop an Operations Coordination Process that will be used in new agreements         between MISO and each of the Joint Parties, other than SPP, when the Operations         Transition Period terminates.75                                d.     SPP Protest of Informational Report         59.     SPP states, in response, that its negotiations with MISO have resulted in some         progress in addressing a single, long-standing concern about the calculation of “market         flows” across the MISO-SPP seam, which has adversely affected the existing congestion         management process under the JOA. SPP further states that this matter has been the         subject of a long-standing, formal dispute resolution under the JOA, and it has not         formally been the subject of any Commission proceedings while that dispute resolution         proceeded.76         60.     SPP notes that, as MISO indicates, SPP and MISO have reached an agreement in         principle that would modify the methodology for calculating market flows under the         JOA, thereby resolving that dispute resolution matter. However, SPP clarifies, a final,         formal resolution has not yet been reached and necessary revisions to the SPP-MISO         JOA have not been filed with the Commission.77         61.     SPP explains that of significance is the Informational Report’s confirmation that         negotiations have not been successful in reaching agreement on other significant         outstanding JOA issues. SPP states that the major gap continues to be the absence of any         resolution of JOA revisions to address SPP’s concerns about the intentional, unscheduled         use of, and compensation for the use of, the SPP transmission system. Thus, SPP argues         that, despite MISO’s representation that MISO and SPP continue to discuss an         appropriate mechanism to compensate for loop flows, the failure of the parties to yet         reach agreement demonstrates that the Commission-ordered negotiations are not an         adequate substitute for formal fact-finding proceedings. To the contrary, SPP notes, with                 75                    Id.                 76                    SPP Protest of Informational Report at 3.                 77                    Id. at 4. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 30 -         the use and compensation issues unresolved, the Commission cannot properly determine         that the pending tariff revisions filed in this docket are just and reasonable.78         62.     Indeed, according to SPP, MISO’s continued characterization of the power flows         crossing SPP’s system as “loop flows” demonstrates a fundamental disconnect in how the         parties view the dispute. SPP explains that loop flows are normally understood as         parallel path flows occurring on adjacent systems when the party causing the flows is         operating within its contract path limit. SPP, however, states that it has never contested,         or sought compensation for, “loop flows,” as conventionally understood. Rather, SPP         continues, the compensation claims asserted by SPP concern the significant unscheduled,         intentional power flows that will cross the SPP system when, post-integration, MISO’s         dispatch exceeds the 1000 MW of direct contract path capacity that currently exists         between MISO and Entergy. Notably, the Commission has never addressed whether         MISO may exceed this 1000 MW limitation, leaving the matter to negotiation, which,         thus far, has failed.79         63.     SPP states that it does not believe that there is any reasonable prospect for         resolution in these private negotiations. SPP notes that, over the course of the parties’         negotiations, SPP has submitted at least three separate proposals to revise the JOA.         According to SPP, to date, it has not received any MISO proposal, despite the         Commission’s admonition that renegotiation of the JOA is necessary. In fact, the JOA         itself imposes an obligation on the parties to renegotiate following changes in a party’s         system configuration. SPP argues that the Commission can bring order to the unsettled         state of affairs by granting rehearing of the Rates Order and establishing hearing and         settlement judge proceedings pursuant to sections 205 and 206 of the FPA to examine the         economic and operational issues caused by the unauthorized, intentional, unscheduled         incremental power flows that will be placed on SPP’s system when MISO is dispatching         its market to reach the remote load of its new member, Entergy. SPP argues that if the         Commission allows the Entergy integration to proceed, it should establish a refund         effective date concerning the use and compensation issues that SPP has raised as of         December 19, 2013, the scheduled date for the Entergy integration. That is, according to         SPP, the only permissible response given the serious questions raised by SPP regarding         the tariff mechanisms proposed by the parties to implement the Entergy-MISO         integration.80                 78                    Id.                 79                    Id. at 5.                 80                    Id. at 6. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                - 31 -                                e.    Commission Determination         64.     We deny rehearing of the Rates Order’s findings regarding loop flow issues.         Although SPP requests that the Commission establish hearing and settlement judge         procedures in this proceeding, we find that doing so is inappropriate; this case is not the         proper forum in which to address these concerns. While we remain interested in the         timely resolution of these issues and are concerned about MISO and SPP’s inability to         resolve these issues, we will not institute a new proceeding under section 206 to address         these issues. These issues are now currently before the Commission in other pending         proceedings. Specifically, on December 3, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the         District of Columbia Circuit vacated and remanded the Commission’s orders interpreting         existing provisions of the MISO-SPP JOA that the Commission had interpreted to allow         MISO to use available transmission capacity on the SPP transmission system to serve         Entergy Arkansas should Entergy Arkansas join MISO.81 The remand proceeding is         pending in Docket No. EL11-34-002. Also, on January 28, 2014, SPP filed an         unexecuted non-firm point-to-point transmission service agreement under FPA         section 205 and a related complaint under FPA section 206, in which SPP seeks         compensation from MISO for certain uses of the SPP transmission system by MISO to         flow power between MISO's northern and southern regions beginning December 19,         2013.82 Additionally, on February 18, 2014, MISO filed a complaint under FPA         section 206, requesting that the Commission direct SPP to cease issuing invoices to         MISO for transmission service and unreserved use penalties and nullify the invoices that         SPP has issued to-date.83         65.     We deny rehearing with respect to the hold harmless request. SPP and TVA take         issue with the Commission’s characterization that the hold harmless protection required         in Commonwealth Edison was due to geographic separation. While the parties debate         whether Entergy is geographically separated from the rest of MISO or not, AEP and         Commonwealth Edison created a void in MISO, separating Wisconsin and Michigan                 81                    Southwest Power Pool, Inc. v. FERC, 736 F.3d 994 (D.C. Cir. 2013).                 82                    See Southwest Power Pool, Inc., Unexecuted Non-Firm Point-to-Point         Transmission Service Agreement, Docket No. ER14-1174-000 (filed Jan. 28, 2014); and         Southwest Power Pool, Inc. v.

We note that Entergy’s integration, however,         does not create a similar void within the SPP footprint. Therefore, the circumstances         surrounding Entergy’s integration are distinct from the circumstances surrounding AEP         and Commonwealth Edison’s integrations into PJM. In any event, the hold harmless         condition imposed by the Commission was intended to be a short-lived solution and not a         long-term solution to managing the MISO-PJM seam.84 The long-term solution was, and         is, the MISO-PJM JOA, which evolved in time and is the foundation for the Joint and         Common Market initiative between the two RTOs.85 As recognized in the Rates Order,         pursuant to the MISO-SPP JOA’s own terms and the requirements of the MISO-SPP-         JOA Order, MISO and SPP are required to renegotiate, in good faith, a revised JOA that         efficiently and fairly manages the MISO-SPP seam as a result of changes in their         footprints. However, as discussed above, such negotiations have failed to date to resolve         these issues, and these issues are currently pending in formal proceedings before the         Commission for resolution. Our decision on the hold harmless request here is without         prejudice to issues in those other pending proceedings.                        4.

The proposed tariff         amendments were conditionally accepted by the Commission on April 19, 2012.

Additionally, the Commission found         that Associated Electric Cooperative was being treated comparably to similarly situated         customers who were requesting drive-through service on MISO’s transmission system,         because any other customers seeking drive-through service across Entergy’s transmission         system would be charged the same rate that Associated Electric Cooperative would be         charged.88                                 b.      Request for Rehearing         67.     The Kansas-Missouri Companies and Associated Electric Cooperative seek         rehearing of the Commission’s determination on the MISO RTOR and the fact that this         issue was not set for hearing and settlement judge procedures. The Kansas-Missouri         Companies assert that the MISO RTOR does not reflect the costs of the Entergy system         and, accordingly, the application of the MISO RTOR to existing transactions through or         out of Entergy is contrary to the long-established ratemaking principle that customers         should pay rates designed to recover the costs of the facilities used to provide the         service.89 The Kansas-Missouri Companies note that, by applying the MISO RTOR to         GMO’s existing long-term service, GMO’s rates for the same service over the same         facilities will increase by 75 percent.90 To remedy this, the Kansas-Missouri Companies         state that, in their initial protests, they requested that the Commission grandfather the         existing transmission service contracts at the existing rates.91 They add that this could         also be achieved by creating a separate RTOR for the Entergy region based on the costs         of Entergy’s facilities.92         68.

Arkansas Electric Cooperative notes that it currently operates under a Power         Coordination, Interchange and Transmission Service Agreement (PCITSA) with Entergy         Arkansas.96 Arkansas Electric Cooperative states that the PCITSA’s transmission service         provisions obligate Entergy Arkansas to deliver Arkansas Electric Cooperative’s member         cooperatives’ power and energy requirements at specified delivery points throughout the         Entergy Arkansas system and, importantly, to deliver power and energy scheduled to         adjacent systems on a firm basis.97 Arkansas Electric Cooperative further states that it         and Entergy Arkansas agreed to terminate the PCITSA upon Entergy’s integration into         MISO and convert the transmission service previously provided under the PCITSA to         open access transmission service under the applicable tariffs of Entergy Arkansas and         MISO.98 Arkansas Electric Cooperative explains that the rate issue here concerns the         transmission service where Entergy Arkansas delivers power and energy scheduled by                 93                    Kansas-Missouri Companies Request for Rehearing at 6 (citing Midwest Indep.

Arkansas Electric Cooperative states that the Commission has imposed conditions         on its acceptance of RTO proposals to ensure that the RTO has an adequate scope and         configuration that, among other things, encompasses one contiguous area and recognizes         trading patterns.102 According to Arkansas Electric Cooperative, the Commission         concluded that “the RTORs in the Midwest ISO/PJM region perpetuate seams that         prevent the realization of more efficient and competitive electricity markets in the region,         and thus violate a central tenet of the Commission’s RTO policy.”103 Arkansas Electric         Cooperative asserts that the circumstances here are similar—but the issue is not whether         the MISO RTOR should be eliminated, but rather, whether the RTOR for service through         or out of the Entergy transmission system reflects the cost of the Entergy facilities used to         provide service, as required by established ratemaking principles.104 Arkansas Electric         Cooperative explains that the MISO RTOR was designed to recover revenues lost when         internal rate pancakes within MISO were eliminated a decade ago.105 Arkansas Electric         Cooperative asserts that the existing RTOR does not reflect the costs of the Entergy                 99                    Id. at 5-6.                 100                     Id.                 101                     Id. at 6.                 102                     Id. at 7 (citing MISO RTOR Order, 104 FERC ¶ 61,105 at P 29).                 103                     Id. at 7-8 (citing MISO RTOR Order, 104 FERC ¶ 61,105 at P 28).                 104                     Id. at 8 (citing Ill.

Arkansas Electric Cooperative states that the Merger Order and Rates Order do not         address arguments raised by GMO regarding the significant rate impact that the MISO         RTOR will have on GMO and similarly situated Entergy transmission customers,         including a request to hold GMO harmless from Entergy’s decision to join MISO.         Arkansas Electric Cooperative states that the RTOR issues were not acknowledged,         addressed, or resolved, and should be included in the issues set for hearing and settlement         judge procedures.107         72.     Associated Electric Cooperative argues that the Commission erred in concluding         that Associated Electric Cooperative’s point-to-point transmission rate increase is “being         addressed currently in the Entergy Cost Allocation Proceeding” because that proceeding         only concerns network upgrade costs between MISO and Entergy and does not concern         baseline rates under Schedule 7 of the MISO Tariff. Associated Electric Cooperative also         explains that the Commission’s orders in the Entergy Cost Allocation proceeding were         limited to addressing network upgrade costs and did not address baseline rates of drive-         through customers, such as Associated Electric Cooperative. Associated Electric         Cooperative states that drive-through customers will be subject to cross-subsidization in a         way that no other transmission customer of MISO will be and the only cause of         Associated Electric Cooperative’s 87 percent rate increase is the integration of Entergy’s         transmission assets into MISO. Associated Electric Cooperative asserts that the         Commission cannot simply sidestep this issue by erroneously asserting that the issue is         being addressed in another proceeding, especially when the issue has not even been         raised in that other proceeding.108         73.     Associated Electric Cooperative argues that the cost for its point-to-point         transmission service will increase by $3.1 million dollars per year, which is an increase of         87 percent over the cost that Associated Electric Cooperative currently pays to         Entergy.109 Associated Electric Cooperative asserts that it will not utilize any facilities in                 106                     Id.                 107                     Id. at 9-10.                 108                     Associated Electric Cooperative Request for Rehearing at 6-9.                 109                     Id. at 9. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 37 -         the pre-Transaction MISO footprint and thus it will not receive any benefits as a result of         the Transaction that justify this substantial rate increase.110         74.     Associated Electric Cooperative explains that all other legacy customers besides         drive-through customers will be charged a zonal rate based on the facilities in their         specific zone.111 Associated Electric Cooperative then argues that the only legacy         customers that will be forced to pay rates based on both the MISO and Entergy footprints         immediately after the integration will be customers, like Associated Electric Cooperative,         that take service under Schedule 7 of the MISO Tariff.112 Associated Electric         Cooperative asserts that ignoring such a rate increase on only drive-through customers         violates the Commission’s cost causation policy.113 Therefore, Associated Electric         Cooperative argues that the Commission should have set this case for hearing and         settlement procedures.114                                c.    Commission Determination         75.      Upon further consideration, we find that MISO’s proposed RTOR for service over         the transmission system in the MISO South region raises issues of material fact that         cannot be resolved based on the record before us, and therefore we grant rehearing and         will institute hearing and settlement judge procedures to address these issues. We find,         based on parties’ arguments on rehearing that the proposed RTOR for service over the         transmission system in the MISO South region has not been shown to be just and         reasonable and may be unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential, or         otherwise unlawful. Therefore, we will grant rehearing to provide a forum for parties to         address the issues raised regarding MISO’s proposed RTOR.         76.     Because the Commission accepted MISO’s proposed RTOR for service over the         transmission system in the MISO South region in the Rates Order without suspension or         setting it for hearing, we will institute a section 206 proceeding, in Docket No. EL14-19-         000, with a refund effective date. In addition, because this investigation will involve         issues of material fact, we will set the matter for a trial-type evidentiary hearing. Given                 110                     Id. at 10.                 111                     Id. at 11.                 112                     Id.                 113                     Id.                 114                     Id. at 14. 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                  - 38 -         the common issues of fact and law, we consolidate Docket No. EL14-19-000 with the         ongoing proceedings in Docket No. ER13-948-000 for purposes of settlement, hearing         and decision.         77.     In cases where, as here, the Commission institutes a section 206 proceeding on its         own motion, section 206(b) requires that the Commission establish a refund effective         date that is no earlier than the date of the publication by the Commission of notice of the         initiation of the Commission's proceeding in the Federal Register, and no later than         five months after the publication date. In order to give maximum protection to         customers, and consistent with our precedent, 115 we will establish a refund effective date         at the earliest date allowed. This date will be the date on which notice of the initiation of         the proceeding in Docket No. EL14-19-000 is published in the Federal Register.         78.     In addition, section 206(b) requires that, if no final decision has been rendered by         the conclusion of the 180-day period commencing upon initiation of a proceeding         pursuant to this section, the Commission shall state the reasons why it has failed to do so         and shall state its best estimate as to when it reasonably expects to make such decision.         Given the nature and complexity of the matters to be resolved, we expect that, assuming         the case does not settle, the presiding judge should be able to render a decision within         nine months of the commencement of hearing procedures, or if the case were to go to         hearing immediately, by October 31, 2014. If the presiding judge is able to render a         decision by that date, and assuming the case does not settle, we estimate that we will be         able to issue our decision within approximately six months of the filing of briefs on and         opposing exceptions or by June 30, 2015.         79.     While we are setting these matters for a trial-type evidentiary hearing, we         encourage the parties to make every effort to settle their disputes before hearing         procedures are commenced. To aid parties in their settlement efforts, we will hold the         hearing in abeyance and direct that a settlement judge be appointed, pursuant to Rule 603         of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure.116 If the parties desire, they may,         by mutual agreement, request a specific judge as the settlement judge in the proceeding;         otherwise, the Chief Judge will select a judge for this purpose.117 The settlement judge                 115                     See, e.g., Canal Electric Co., 46 FERC ¶ 61,153, reh’g denied, 47 FERC         ¶ 61,275 (1989).                 116                     18 C.F.R. § 385.603 (2013).                 117                     If the parties decide to request a specific judge, they must make their joint         request to the Chief Judge by telephone at (202) 502-8500 within five (5) days of this         order.

Such settlement judge shall have all powers and duties enumerated in Rule 603         and shall convene a settlement conference as soon as practicable after the Chief Judge         designates a settlement judge. If the parties decide to request a specific judge, they must         make their request to the Chief Judge within five (5) days of the date of this order.                 (F)    Within thirty (30) days of the date of this order, the settlement judge shall         file a report with the Commission and the Chief Judge on the status of settlement         settlement proceedings and a summary of their background and experience         (http://www.ferc.gov/legal/adr/avail-judge.asp). 20140220-3019 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 02/20/2014         Docket No. ER12-2681-000, et al.                                                   - 40 -         discussions. Based on this report, the Chief Judge shall provide the parties with         additional time to continue their settlement discussions, if appropriate, or assign this case         to a presiding judge for a trial-type evidentiary hearing, if appropriate. If settlement         discussions continue, the settlement judge shall file a report at least every sixty (60) days         thereafter, informing the Commission and the Chief Judge of the parties' progress toward         settlement.                 (G) If settlement judge procedures fail and a trial-type evidentiary hearing is         to be held, a presiding judge, to be designated by the Chief Judge, shall, within         fifteen (15) days of the date of the presiding judge’s designation, convene a prehearing         conference in these proceedings in a hearing room of the Commission, 888 First Street,         NE, Washington, DC 20426. Such a conference shall be held for the purpose of         establishing a procedural schedule. The presiding judge is authorized to establish         procedural dates and rule on all motions (except motions to dismiss) as provided in the         Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure.

In this order, the Commission denies rehearing of the Commission’s February 20,         2014 order, 1 which addressed, inter alia, the rates for service over the facilities of certain               1                 ITC Holdings Corp., 146 FERC ¶ 61,111 (2014) (Rates Rehearing Order). 20150626-3041 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/26/2015         Docket No. ER12-2681-003, et al.                                                   -2-         subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation (Entergy)2 upon their integration into the Midwest         Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO).3         I.     Background         2.     On June 20, 2013, the Commission issued several orders conditionally accepting         certain proposed tariff revisions submitted under section 205 of the Federal Power Act         (FPA)4 and Part 35 of the Commission’s regulations,5 and accepting and suspending         certain proposed tariff revisions and establishing hearing and settlement judge         procedures.6 In the Rates Order, the Commission addressed two separate proposals         regarding the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies’ transmission facilities into         MISO: (1) Docket No. ER13-948-000, which addressed the integration of the Entergy         Operating Companies into MISO; and (2) Docket Nos. ER12-2681-000 and ER13-782-         000, which addressed the section 205 issues raised by a proposed transaction in Docket         No. EC12-145-000 pursuant to which the transmission assets of the Entergy Operating         Companies would be transferred to certain newly formed subsidiaries of ITC Holdings         Corp. (ITC) (New ITC Operating Companies) (Entergy-ITC Transaction) prior to the         integration of those transmission assets into MISO.7                2                  Entergy Arkansas, Inc., Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C., Entergy         Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Mississippi, Inc., Entergy New Orleans, Inc., and Entergy         Texas, Inc. (collectively, Entergy Operating Companies).                3                  Effective April 26, 2013, MISO changed its name from “Midwest Independent         Transmission System Operator, Inc.” to “Midcontinent Independent System Operator,         Inc.”                4                  16 U.S.C. § 824d (2012).                5                  18 C.F.R.

On December 13, 2013, the New ITC Operating Companies filed a motion to         withdraw the filings in Docket Nos. ER12-2681-000 and ER13-782-000. Further, on         December 13, 2013, ITC and Entergy filed a Notice of Termination of Transaction in         Docket No. EC12-145-000, notifying the Commission that the Entergy-ITC Transaction         would not occur. 20150626-3041 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/26/2015         Docket No. ER12-2681-003, et al.                                                       -3-         3.      The Commission denied requests that the Commission confirm that ITC Holdings         and MISO will apply the Entergy transition plan for Multi-Value Project (MVP) and         non-MVP network upgrade costs to the transmission rates of all Entergy customers,         including point-to-point customers.8 The Commission also found that any request to         receive similar treatment as that provided in the Entergy Cost Allocation proceeding was         beyond the scope of the instant proceeding. Additionally, the Commission found that         Associated Electric Cooperative Corporation (Associated Electric Cooperative) was         being treated comparably to similarly situated customers who were requesting regional         through and out transmission service on MISO’s transmission system, because any other         customers seeking regional through and out transmission service across Entergy’s         transmission system would be charged the same rate that Associated Electric Cooperative         would be charged.9 The Commission, among other things: (1) accepted the proposed         transmission pricing zones for the Entergy Operating Companies; and (2) accepted and         suspended the Entergy Operating Companies’ MISO Attachment O formula rates,         summarily resolved certain issues concerning those rates, and established hearing and         settlement judge procedures to address the remaining issues concerning those rates.         4.      Several parties filed requests for rehearing and/or clarification of the Rates Order.         As relevant here, certain parties10 asked the Commission to confirm that issues they had         raised regarding the application to pre-existing Entergy transmission customers of the         proposed through and out rates (RTOR) for the MISO South region were among the         issues set for hearing in the Rates Order and that such issues were not summarily         resolved in the Rates Order. They also argued that, if the Commission did not set the         RTOR issue for hearing, the Commission should do so in light of a significant rate         increase that would result from Entergy’s integration into MISO.         5.      On February 20, 2014, the Commission granted the requests for rehearing on the         RTOR issue, instituted an FPA section 206 proceeding in Docket No. EL14-19-000,                 8                   Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 171. In the Entergy Cost Allocation         proceeding in Docket No. ER12-480-000, MISO and the MISO Transmission Owners         proposed amendments to the MISO Tariff to provide for a five-year transition period for         the integration of Entergy into the MISO transmission planning and cost allocation         process. The proposed tariff amendments were conditionally accepted by the         Commission on April 19, 2012. Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys.

However,         the Commission reasoned that because it had accepted MISO’s proposed RTOR for         service over the transmission system in the MISO South region in the Rates Order         without suspension or setting it for hearing, it would institute a section 206 proceeding to         address the issues raised regarding MISO’s proposed RTOR. In order to give maximum         protection to customers, and consistent with Commission precedent, the Commission         established a refund effective date at the earliest date allowed – the date on which notice         of the proceeding in Docket No. EL14-19-000 was published in the Federal Register.         II.     Request for Rehearing         6.      The Kansas-Missouri Companies filed a request for rehearing of the Rates         Rehearing Order raising two issues. First, the Kansas-Missouri Companies argue that the         Commission erred in failing to clarify on rehearing that the RTOR issues were not         summarily resolved in the Rates Order, but were among the issues set for hearing and         settlement judge procedures subject to refund. The Kansas-Missouri Companies assert         that the Commission erred in allowing a rate that has not been shown to be just and         reasonable to go into effect over the unaddressed and unresolved objections of customers         subject to that rate. They contend that these errors improperly shift the burden of proof         from the applicants in these proceedings to the Kansas-Missouri Companies, thereby         excusing the applicants from their statutory burden of demonstrating that the rate increase         they had proposed is just and reasonable.12 Second, the Kansas-Missouri Companies         argue that the Commission erred in failing to suspend the effectiveness of the application         of the RTOR to the MISO South region from the initial date the application of that rate to         the MISO South region became effective, i.e., December 19, 2013.         III.    Discussion         7.      We deny rehearing of the Commission’s finding in the Rates Rehearing Order that         the RTOR issue was not among the issues that were set for hearing and settlement judge         procedures in the Rates Order. In the Rates Order, the Commission stated that it was         setting the issues raised in that proceeding for hearing except for the issues summarily         resolved in that order. One of the issues addressed was the RTOR issue raised by                 11                    Rates Rehearing Order, 146 FERC ¶ 61,111.                 12                    Kansas-Missouri Companies Request for Rehearing at 9-11. 20150626-3041 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/26/2015         Docket No. ER12-2681-003, et al.                                                      -5-         Associated Electric Cooperative about similarly situated customers receiving regional         through and out transmission service. The Commission also addressed other RTOR-         related issues in the Merger Order.13 In the Rates Rehearing Order, the Commission         stated that it accepted MISO’s proposed RTOR for service over the transmission system         in the MISO South region. However, we clarify that, specifically, the Rates Order,         among other things, accepted: (1) revisions to Schedules 7, 8, and 9, which define the         boundaries of the transmission pricing zones, to reflect the inclusion of the Entergy         Operating Companies’ transmission system under the MISO Tariff through the addition         of four new transmission pricing zones; and (2) the Entergy Operating Companies’ MISO         Attachment O formula rate template, which is used to calculate their license plate zonal         rates and the MISO regional average RTOR. Thus, the Commission accepted proposed         tariff provisions to reflect the integration of the Entergy Operating Companies’         transmission system into MISO under MISO’s existing filed rate, the RTOR. While the         Commission suspended the Entergy Operating Companies’ formula rate templates, made         them subject to refund, and set them for hearing and settlement judge procedures, the         RTOR was MISO’s existing filed rate applicable for regional through and out         transmission service throughout the MISO footprint. Thus, the Commission was required         in the Rates Rehearing Order to proceed under section 206 to establish a proceeding to         address issues raised regarding the justness and reasonableness of that rate design. The         Commission would have been required to proceed under section 206 even if it had made         this determination in the Rates Order. Likewise, because the RTOR was the filed rate,         MISO did not have the burden to demonstrate that the RTOR was just and reasonable.         Accordingly, we disagree with Kansas-Missouri Companies’ argument that the         Commission improperly shifted the burden of proof by establishing hearing and         settlement judge procedures under section 206 of the FPA rather than section 205, and         affirm the Commission’s determination that action under section 206 of the FPA was         required.         8.      When the Commission establishes a section 206 proceeding on its own motion, the         earliest refund effective date that the Commission can establish is “the date of the         publication by the Commission of notice of its intention to initiate such proceeding…”14         Accordingly, in order to give maximum protection to customers, the Commission         established a refund effective date of February 27, 2014, the date that the notice for the         section 206 proceeding established in the Rates Rehearing Order was published in the         Federal Register. We affirm the refund effective date established in the Rates Rehearing         Order.                 13                    See ITC Holdings Corp., 143 FERC ¶ 61,256, at PP 100-40 (2013).                 14                    16 U.S.C. § 824e(b) (2012). 20150626-3041 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 06/26/2015         Docket No. ER12-2681-003, et al.                                                 -6-         The Commission orders:                The Kansas-Missouri Companies’ request for rehearing is hereby denied, as         discussed in the body of this order.

On October 21, 2013, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA)1         and Part 35 of the regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or         Commission),2 the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) filed a         Notice of Succession for certain Transmission Service Agreements entered into by and         between Entergy Services, Inc. (Entergy Services) and the Entergy Operating         Companies3 (collectively, Entergy) and various transmission customers (Transmission         Service Agreements).4 As discussed further below, we accept the Notice of Succession         for filing.                 1                   16 U.S.C. § 824d (2012).                 2                   18 C.F.R.

MISO states that the Notice of Succession evidences those ongoing         transactions that are being transferred from the Entergy Open Access Transmission Tariff         (Entergy OATT) to the MISO Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve                                                                                   (continued…) 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                          -2-         I.      Background and Summary of Filing         2.      In April 2011, the Entergy Operating Companies announced their decision to join         MISO. Since that time, the Entergy Operating Companies have submitted multiple         filings with the Commission to accomplish the integration.5 Currently, the target date for         integrating the Entergy Operating Companies into MISO is December 19, 2013.         3.      In the Notice of Succession Filing, MISO requests authorization to take         assignment of certain Transmission Service Agreements that are ongoing under the         Entergy OATT. MISO explains that taking assignment of the agreements will obligate it         Markets Tariff (MISO Tariff) and is filed in accordance with 18 C.F.R. § 36.16 (2013).         Id. at 2.                 5                   The Commission addressed some of these filings in ITC Holdings, Inc.,         143 FERC ¶ 61,257 (2013) (Entergy-ITC Rates Order). In that order, the Commission         addressed filings related to the integration and a proposed transaction pursuant to which         the transmission assets of the Entergy Operating Companies would be transferred to         certain subsidiaries of ITC Holdings Corp. (ITC) (New ITC Operating Companies)         (Entergy-ITC Transaction). Among the issues addressed in the Entergy-ITC Rates Order         was a proposal to establish four transmission pricing zones for the Entergy Operating         Companies (the Entergy Transmission Pricing Zones), and proposed formula rate         templates under Attachment O of the MISO Tariff for the Entergy Operating Companies         and certain ITC operating companies. The filings addressed in the Entergy-ITC Rates         Order were submitted in Docket Nos. ER12-2681-000, ER13-948-000, and ER13-782-         000; that order consolidated those dockets. We refer to the consolidated proceedings as         the Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding. In the Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding, the         Commission accepted the proposed Entergy Transmission Pricing Zones and ruled on the         rates for both the New ITC Operating Companies, in event of the merger, and the Entergy         Operating Companies, upon joining MISO. The Entergy Transmission Pricing Zones and         the formula rate templates for the Entergy Operating Companies will go into effect         on December 19, 2013, and the formula rate templates for the New ITC Operating         Companies would have gone into effect upon closing of the transaction. We note that on         December 13, 2013, the New ITC Operating Companies filed a motion to withdraw the         filings in Docket Nos. ER12-2681-00 and ER13-782-000. Motion to Withdraw Filings of         ITC Holdings Corp., ITC Arkansas LLC, ITC Texas LLC, ITC Louisiana LLC and ITC         Mississippi, LLC, Docket Nos. ER12-2681-000 and ER13-782-000 (consolidated)         (Dec. 13, 2013). Further, Entergy Services and ITC filed a notice of termination of the         proposed transaction on the same day. Notice of Termination of Transaction, Docket         No. EC12-145-000 (Dec. 13, 2013). 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                               -3-         to provide transmission service pursuant to the MISO Tariff. According to MISO, at         12:00 am on December 19, 2013, the Entergy Operating Companies will become fully-         integrated transmission-owning members of MISO. MISO states that at that time,         succession of the Transmission Service Agreements to the MISO Tariff will occur, and         MISO will have completed a transfer of functional control and a transfer of contractual         arrangements to provide transmission service for the Entergy Operating Companies and         its former customers. MISO states that as a result of the succession, transmission-related         services previously available from Entergy under the Entergy OATT will become         available pursuant to the MISO Tariff.6         4.      According to MISO, the agreements that are the subject of the Notice of         Succession consist of those Transmission Service Agreements under the Entergy OATT         that are ongoing i.e., those service agreements that commence on or continue through         December 19, 2013. MISO explains that these agreements must be transferred to the         MISO Tariff effective December 19, 2013 in order to ensure that the customers who are         parties to the agreements will continue to be served under the MISO Tariff.7         5.      The Notice of Succession, which is included in Tab A of the Notice of Succession         Filing, states that the notice is intended to transfer only the provisions and obligations of         transmission service from the Entergy Operating Companies to MISO. The Notice of         Succession states that it is not intended to affect, impair, or alter the contractual         obligations, if applicable, of the Entergy Operating Companies to provide certain         ancillary services or contractual right to receive revenues from Transmission Customers         for such ancillary services. The Notice of Succession states that any revenues received         by MISO for transmission service under the transferred Transmission Service         Agreements and Network Integration Transmission Service Agreements, excluding         amounts pursuant to Schedule 10 (ISO Cost Recovery Adder), Schedule 16 (Financial         Transmission Rights Administrative Service Cost Recovery), and Schedule 17 (Energy         Market Support Administrative Service Cost Recovery) (collectively, these excluded         amounts are referred to as MISO Administrative Costs), will be owned by the Entergy         Operating Companies and held by MISO as the custodial trustee for the Entergy         Operating Companies and will be received by MISO solely as agent for the Entergy         Operating Companies consistent with Appendix C of the Agreement of Transmission         Facilities Owners to Organize the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., A         Delaware Non-Stock Corporation (MISO Transmission Owners Agreement). Under the         Notice of Succession, except for the MISO Administrative Costs, MISO will hold no         legal, equitable, or contractual title to, or rights or interest in, such revenues received                 6                   Notice of Succession Filing, Transmittal Letter at 2.                 7                   Id. 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                          -4-         from the transferred Transmission Service Agreements and Network Integration         Transmission Service Agreements.         6.     Finally, MISO requests that the Commission waive any regulations that it may         deem applicable to the Notice of Succession Filing that have not been specifically         addressed in that filing.8         II.    Notice of Filing and Responsive Pleadings         7.     Notice of the filing by MISO was published in the Federal Register 78 Fed. Reg.         64,491, with interventions and comments due on or before November 12, 2013.         8.     The NRG Companies,9 Ameren Services Company,10 South Mississippi Electric         Power Association, and the ITC Companies11 filed timely motions to intervene. Entergy         Services filed, on behalf of the Entergy Operating Companies, a motion to intervene out         of time.         9.     Kansas City Power & Light Company and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations         Company (individually, KCP&L Greater Missouri) (together, Kansas City Power &         Light), The Empire District Electric Company (Empire), and Associated Electric         Cooperative, Inc. (Associated Electric) filed motions to intervene and protest. Missouri         Joint Municipal Electric Utility Commission (MJMEUC) filed a motion to intervene and         comments.                8                  Id. at 5.                9                  For purposes of their intervention in this proceeding, the NRG Companies are         Louisiana Generating LLC; NRG Power Marketing LLC; GenOn Energy Management,         LLC; Bayou Cove Peaking Power LLC; Big Cajun 1 Peaking Power LLC; NRG         Sterlington Power LLC; Cottonwood Energy Company LP; and NRG Wholesale         Generation LP.                10                   Ameren Services Company files on behalf of its affiliated public utility         operating companies, Ameren Illinois Company and Union Electric Company d/b/a         Ameren Missouri (Ameren Missouri) (collectively, Ameren).                11                   The ITC Companies consist of International Transmission Company d/b/a         ITCTransmission; Michigan Electric Transmission Company, LLC; and ITC Midwest         LLC. 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                             -5-         10.     On November 22, 2013, MISO and Entergy filed a joint motion for leave to         answer and answer. On December 5, 2013, Associated Electric and Kansas City Power         & Light filed answers.12         III.    Discussion                 A.      Procedural Matters         11.     Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure,13 the         timely, unopposed motions to intervene serve to make the entities that filed them parties         to these proceedings. Pursuant to Rule 214(d) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and         Procedure,14 we will grant the late-filed motion to intervene given Entergy’s interest in         this proceeding, the early stages of the proceeding, and the absence of undue prejudice or         delay.         12.     Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure 15 prohibit an         answer to a protest or answer unless otherwise ordered by the decisional authority. We         will accept the answer filed in this proceeding because it has provided information that         assisted us in our decision-making process.                 B.      Substantive Matters                         1.     Comments and Protests         13.     Kansas City Power & Light states that one of the Transmission Service         Agreements that is subject to the Notice of Succession is an agreement pursuant to which         Entergy provides transmission service to KCP&L Greater Missouri, the Crossroads         Transmission Service Agreement (Crossroads TSA). According to Kansas City Power &         Light, assignment of the Crossroads TSA to MISO should not be approved because it will                 12                    In addition to filing its answer in this proceeding, Associated Electric filed its         answer in Docket Nos. ER14-89-000, ER14-114-000, and ER14-115-000 (regarding         filings by Entergy and MISO proposing alternative transmission arrangements for certain         transmission facilities owned by Entergy Arkansas located in Missouri); and ER14-107-         000 (filing by MISO to, among other things, revise references to the Entergy         Transmission Pricing Zones in the MISO Tariff).                 13                    18 C.F.R. § 385.214 (2013).                 14                    18 C.F.R. § 385.214(d) (2013).                 15                    18 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2) (2013). 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                           -6-         result in an unjust and unreasonable rate increase. Kansas City Power & Light states that         the current rate under the Crossroads TSA is an approved cost of service rate, but that         once under the MISO Tariff, KCP&L Greater Missouri’s rate for the same service will         increase.16 Kansas City Power & Light alleges that a Notice of Succession is not the         appropriate filing for requesting authorization to assign jurisdictional contracts where that         assignment will result in a substantial increase in rates,17 and that MISO and Entergy         have not made any attempt to justify the requested assignment or the resultant substantial         rate increase in this or any other docket.18 In particular, Kansas City Power & Light         faults Entergy and MISO for failing to seek proper approval under sections 203 and 205         of the Federal Power Act.19 According to Kansas City Power & Light, because neither         Entergy nor MISO has made the requisite showing to effectuate an increase in rates or         assignment of a jurisdictional contract, the Commission should either (1) reject the         Notice of Succession Filing, or (2) accept the Notice of Succession Filing, suspend the         rate increase under the Crossroads TSA for five months, and establish settlement judge         and hearing procedures.20                 16                    Motion to Intervene and Protest of Kansas City Power & Light Company and         KPC&L Greater Missouri Operations Company at 7-11, Docket No. ER14-148-000         (Kansas City Power & Light Protest).                 17                    Id. at 11-13 (citing Guidance on Regional Transmission Organization and         Independent System Operator Filing Requirements under the Federal Power Act,         104 FERC ¶ 61,248, at P 3, n.1 (2003) (RTO Guidance Order); Midwest Indep.

In Docket No. ER14-107-000, MISO submitted revisions to the         MISO Tariff to reference several transmission pricing zones and the transmission owners         in those zones.                 19                    16 U.S.C. § 824b and 824e (2012). Kansas City Power & Light asserts that to         comply with FPA section 205, Entergy and MISO must make a proper showing under         section 35.13 of the Commission’s regulations, which sets out the filing requirements for         rates; to comply with FPA section 203, Entergy and MISO must, among other things,         demonstrate that the transfer has no adverse effect on rates. Kansas City Power & Light         Protest at 13.                 20                    Kansas City Power & Light Protest at 2, 13. 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                           -7-         14.     Empire echoes Kansas City Power & Light’s arguments, asserting that by using a         Notice of Succession to transfer transmission service from the Entergy OATT to the         MISO Tariff, MISO has side-stepped the requirements of FPA section 205 and the         Commission’s regulations to show that the proposed substantial rate change is just and         reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory.21 Empire argues that, due to the application         of the MISO through-and-out rate under Schedule 7 of the MISO Tariff (RTOR) to its         service, the change in transmission provider will result in an over 70 percent increase in         its long term point-to-point transmission service costs despite receiving similar services         on the same Entergy transmission facilities.22 Empire asserts that this increase will         provide a windfall for Entergy. Empire claims that the Notice of Succession Filing         departs from the typical notice of succession filing, which is a type of ministerial filing,         and includes substantive changes.23 Empire argues that the Commission should reject the         Notice of Succession Filing and direct MISO to resubmit a filing under FPA section 205         and section 35.15 of the Commission’s regulations to convert the existing Transmission         Service Agreements under the Entergy OATT to service under the MISO Tariff based on         a grandfathered or MISO South zonal rate. In the alternative, Empire requests that the         Commission suspend the Notice of Succession, subject to refund, for the maximum         period permitted, and establish hearing and settlement procedures.24         15.     Like Empire and Kansas City Power & Light, Associated Electric raises concerns         regarding its transmission service agreements with Entergy that will be transferred to         MISO. Associated Electric states that it is Commission policy not to permit a Notice of         Succession to implement a rate increase without a demonstration that the proposed rate         increase is just and reasonable.25 Associated Electric asserts that, as explained in its         comments and rehearing request of the Entergy-ITC Rates Order, the point-to-point                 21                    Motion to Intervene and Protest of The Empire District Electric Company at 4,         Docket No. ER14-148-000 (Nov. 12, 2013) (Empire Protest).                 22                    Id. at 5. Empire recognizes that whether the post-integration RTOR is just and         reasonable, as applied to existing transmission customers under the Entergy OATT, is an         issue pending on rehearing in the Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding. Id. at 5-6.                 23                    Id. at 3-4.                 24                    Id. at 6.                 25                    Motion to Intervene and Protest of Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. at 3,         Docket No. ER14-148-000 (Nov. 12, 2013) (Associated Electric Protest) (citing Midwest         Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc., 109 FERC ¶ 61,185 (2004), reh’g         denied, 113 FERC ¶ 61,208 (2005)). 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                            -8-         transmission service it currently receives from Entergy will be subject to the RTOR,         resulting in an 87 percent increase in its rates, without any change in the utilization of         legacy Entergy transmission assets or any use of legacy MISO transmission assets.26         Associated Electric argues that MISO provides no testimony, analysis, or exhibits that         explain why such an increase to point-to-point transmission service is justified.         Associated Electric requests that the Commission accept the Notice of Succession Filing         subject to the condition that the rates charged under the Transmission Service         Agreements are no higher than the rates currently charged under the Entergy OATT. In         the alternative, Associated Electric requests that the Commission set the rates for hearing         and settlement judge procedures to establish just and reasonable rates. 27         16.     MJMEUC states that it has no objection to MISO’s proposed succession to the         Transmission Service Agreements per se, but that any relief provided to existing point-to         point customers from the RTOR, whether established through settlement or litigation,         should apply to it on a comparable basis.28 MJMEUC also notes that one of the         Transmission Service Agreements is an existing Network Integration Transmission         Service Agreement between it and Entergy for service to the City of Thayer, Missouri         (City of Thayer).29 MJMEUC points out that in Docket No. ER14-115-000, MISO has         filed a new proposed agreement for service for the City of Thayer load due to alternative         arrangements that Entergy has proposed for service over certain transmission facilities         located in Missouri that it will not be transferring functional control of to MISO at this         time. MJMEUC argues that the filing of duplicative agreements for the same network         load introduces confusion as to which is the governing agreement, and that one or the         other should be eliminated.30                 26                    Id. at 4-5.                 27                    Id. at 6-8 (citing Midwest Indep.

Answer         17.     MISO and Entergy argue that the Commission should reject challenges to the         RTOR in this proceeding, and not set the Notice of Succession for hearing, because         (1) the Commission already addressed the arguments raised by protestors in this         proceeding in the Entergy-ITC Rates Order; (2) those arguments are pending on         rehearing in the Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding; and (3) the arguments in this proceeding         constitute collateral attacks on the Entergy-ITC Rates Order.31 Further, MISO and         Entergy argue that the Commission should not set the Notice of Succession Filing for         hearing because protestors have not identified any disputed issues of material fact that         need to be resolved at hearing nor any other special circumstances that would justify a         hearing.32 MISO and Entergy also call on the Commission to reject the request to         suspend the Notice of Succession for a five-month period. MISO and Entergy state that         the purpose of the Commission’s suspension policy is to deter “‘substantially excessive’”         rate requests that are not justified by the filing public utility’s cost of service.33 MISO         and Entergy explain that in this case, the applicable MISO rate is the filed rate based on         the cost of service of all MISO transmission owners, and, as such, the rate has already         been approved by the Commission as a just and reasonable rate.         18.     MISO and Entergy assert that intervenors seek preferential treatment that would         give them a lower rate than the rate paid by other through-and-out customers, but that the         Commission rejected the same request in the Entergy-ITC Rates Order and has         previously rejected requests like it.34 Finally, MISO and Entergy dispute claims that the         Notice of Succession will produce a windfall for Entergy. MISO and Entergy explain         that protestors ignore that the MISO Transmission Owners Agreement provides that         revenues from the RTOR will be split among the MISO transmission zones, 50 percent                 31                    Motion for Leave to Answer and Answer of Midcontinent Independent System         Operator, Inc. and Entergy Services, Inc. at 8-9, Docket No. ER14-148-000         (Nov. 22, 2013) (Joint Answer).                 32                    Id. at 11-12.                 33                    Id. at 12 (quoting W.

In its answer, Associated Electric reiterates several arguments that it has raised in         other related dockets.36 First, Associated Electric argues that it did not waive its legal         right to challenge the rate increase due to the RTOR by failing to raise the issue in         Docket No. ER13-948-000. Associated Electric states that it raised the issue in the         Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding and that it remains pending there. Second, Associated         Electric disputes MISO and Entergy Services’ claim that providing relief from rate         increase due to the RTOR would be unduly preferential. According to Associated         Electric, it is not similarly situated to existing MISO customers taking service pursuant to         the RTOR, and it is unfair that the only legacy Entergy customers that will be forced to         pay rates based on both the MISO and Entergy footprints will be customers that are         forced to pay the RTOR.37 Finally, Associated Electric rejects MISO and Entergy         Services’ claim that the rate increase is just and reasonable because of the benefits of         taking service under the MISO Tariff. Associated Electric states that it did not seek out         the alleged benefits for its existing service, and that since its transmission service         agreements with Entergy were used on an ad hoc basis, it will not seek to use any         additional MISO facilities, receipt points, or delivery points beyond those it currently         uses. Associated Electric again requests that the Commission suspend any rate increase,         subject the rate to refund, and set the RTOR for hearing and settlement judge         procedures.38         20.     Citing the Entergy-ITC Rates Order, Kansas City Power & Light alleges that the         Commission explicitly stated that parties would have the opportunity to raise concerns                 35                    Id. at 10 (citing MISO Transmission Owners Agreement, Appendix C,         section III.A.7).                 36                    See e.g., Answer of Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. to Answers of         Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., Entergy Services, Inc., and Entergy         Arkansas, Inc. at 2-3, 7-9, 13-14, Docket Nos. ER14-89-000, ER14-107-000, ER14-114-         000, ER14-115-000, and ER14-148-000 (not consolidated) (Dec. 5, 2013) (Associated         Electric Answer).                 37                    Id. at 9-10.                 38                    Id. at 16. 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                           - 11 -         when notices of succession were filed.39 Kansas City Power & Light argues that,         accordingly, this proceeding is the proper proceeding in which the Commission should         consider its arguments. Kansas City Power & Light also dispute Entergy and MISO’s         interpretations of Commission precedent regarding as-applied challenges to rate increases         resulting from RTO integration, asserting that the facts in this case support rejection of         the Notice of Succession Filing or a hearing. Finally, cross-referencing their answer in         Docket No. ER14-107-000,40 Kansas City Power & Light argue: (1) that because the         substantial rate increases will occur due to the filings in Docket No. ER14-107-000 and         this proceeding, these are the correct dockets in which the Commission should address its         concerns; (2) that Kansas City Power & Light was provided no notice in Docket No.         ER13-948-000 that that was the correct docket for addressing the rate increase under the         Crossroads TSA; (3) that the Commission did not address the RTOR issue in the Entergy-         ITC Rates Order; (4) that it is incorrect to argue that Kansas City Power & Light are         challenging a filed rate because the filed rate that will replace the Entergy rate is pending         in Docket No. ER14-107-000; (5) that preferential rate treatment already exists; and (6)         that Entergy’s argument that it will not receive all of the increased revenues is not         compelling and fails to provide justification for the increase.41                         3.    Commission Determination         21.     The Commission accepts the Notice of Succession for filing to be effective         December 19, 2013, and, to the extent necessary, grants MISO’s request for waiver. As         MISO explains, the Transmission Service Agreements subject to the Notice of         Succession must be transferred to the MISO Tariff to ensure that the transmission         customers who are party to those agreements will continue to receive transmission         service. The Notice of Succession ensures that there will be no gaps in transmission         service after the Entergy Operating Companies are integrated into MISO.         22.     In the Entergy-ITC Rates Proceeding, several parties, including Empire and         Kansas City Power & Light, challenged the application of the RTOR to customers in                 39                    Motion for Leave to Answer and Answer of Kansas City Power & Light         Company and LCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company at 2-3 (citing Entergy-ITC         Rates Order, 143 FERC ¶ 61,257 at P 177), Docket No. ER14-148-000 (Dec. 5, 2013).                 40                    Docket No. ER14-107-000 addresses MISO’s proposed revisions to the         references to the Entergy Transmission Pricing Zones in the MISO Tariff.                 41                    Id. at 8. 20131218-3040 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 12/18/2013         Docket No. ER14-148-000                                                       - 12 -         MISO South.42 These parties, with the addition of Associated Electric, also requested         rehearing of the Entergy-ITC Rates Order with respect to the RTOR issues.43 In fact,         Kansas City Power & Light and Empire have maintained that the Commission did not         address all of the issues related to the application of the RTOR to MISO South customers         in the Entergy-ITC Rates Order and that those issues are currently pending on         rehearing.44 The Commission will address the arguments on those issues in that         proceeding rather than in this proceeding.         The Commission orders:                The Notice of Succession is accepted for filing, to be effective December 19,         2013, as requested, as discussed in the body of this order.
